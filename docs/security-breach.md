## Summary – Handling of a Security Breach

In the event of a confirmed security breach where an attacker has gained access to the database and selected user data, it is essential to respond quickly and responsibly in order to limit damage and restore trust. The primary focus of the solution is user protection and risk reduction rather than technical implementation details.

Since only a subset of users is affected, the system must be able to identify and mark compromised accounts. When an affected user attempts to use the application, they should be clearly informed about the breach and prevented from continuing normal usage. Informing users alone is not sufficient; they must be forced to take a concrete action before regaining access.

For this reason, access to the system’s functionality should be restricted until the user has changed their password. The user is guided directly to a password change flow, and only after completing this step is normal access restored. This ensures that potentially compromised credentials can no longer be misused and that continued access is based on updated and safer authentication information.

This approach reduces the risk of further misuse, demonstrates responsible handling of security incidents, and establishes a controlled recovery process for affected users. It also signals that the system takes security seriously and prioritizes the protection of user data. While a real-world response would typically include additional security improvements, the core requirement of this assignment is fulfilled by combining clear communication with enforced user action.
