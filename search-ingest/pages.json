    "content": "Information theory is the mathematical study of the quantification, storage, and communication of a particular type of mathematically defined information. The field was established and formalized by Claude Shannon in the 1940s,[1] though early contributions were made in the 1920s through the works of Harry Nyquist and Ralph Hartley. It is at the intersection of electronic engineering, mathematics, statistics, computer science, neurobiology, physics, and electrical engineering.[2][3][4]\nAs a simple example, if you flip a fair coin and don't know the outcome (heads or tails), then you lack a certain amount of information. If you look at the coin, you will know the outcome, and you will gain that same amount of information. For a fair coin, the probability of either heads or tails is 1/2 and that amount of information can be expressed as  = 1 bit of information.\nA key measure in information theory is information entropy. Entropy is equal to the lack of information about a random variable or the outcome of a random process. In the above coin flip example, the entropy in the case where you don't know the outcome is 1 bit. In the case where you do know the outcome, the entropy is zero. As another example, knowing the outcome of a fair coin flip (which has two equally likely outcomes) provides less information (lower entropy, less uncertainty) than identifying the outcome from a roll of a die (which has six equally likely outcomes). Some other important measures in information theory are mutual information, channel capacity, error exponents, and relative entropy. Important sub-fields of information theory include source coding, algorithmic complexity theory, algorithmic information theory and information-theoretic security.\nApplications of fundamental topics of information theory include source coding/data compression (e.g. for ZIP files), and channel coding/error detection and correction (e.g. for DSL). Its impact has been crucial to the success of the Voyager missions to deep space,[5] the invention of the compact disc, the feasibility of mobile phones and the development of the Internet and artificial intelligence.[6][7][4] The theory has also found applications in other areas, including statistical inference,[8] cryptography, neurobiology,[9] perception,[10] signal processing,[2] linguistics, the evolution[11] and function[12] of molecular codes (bioinformatics), thermal physics,[3][13] molecular dynamics,[14] black holes, quantum computing, information retrieval, intelligence gathering, plagiarism detection,[15] pattern recognition, anomaly detection,[16] the analysis of music,[17][18] art creation,[19] imaging system design,[20] study of outer space,[21] the dimensionality of space,[22] and epistemology.[23]\n\n\n\nInformation theory studies the transmission, processing, extraction, and utilization of information. Abstractly, information can be thought of as the resolution of uncertainty. In the case of communication of information over a noisy channel, this abstract concept was formalized in 1948 by Claude Shannon in a paper entitled A Mathematical Theory of Communication, in which information is thought of as a set of possible messages, and the goal is to send these messages over a noisy channel, and to have the receiver reconstruct the message with low probability of error, in spite of the channel noise. Shannon's main result, the noisy-channel coding theorem, showed that, in the limit of many channel uses, the rate of information that is asymptotically achievable is equal to the channel capacity, a quantity dependent merely on the statistics of the channel over which the messages are sent.[9]\nCoding theory is concerned with finding explicit methods, called codes, for increasing the efficiency and reducing the error rate of data communication over noisy channels to near the channel capacity. These codes can be roughly subdivided into data compression (source coding) and error-correction (channel coding) techniques. In the latter case, it took many years to find the methods Shannon's work proved were possible.[24][25]\nA third class of information theory codes are cryptographic algorithms (both codes and ciphers). Concepts, methods and results from coding theory and information theory are widely used in cryptography and cryptanalysis,[26] such as the unit ban.\n\nHistorical background[edit]\n\nThe landmark event establishing the discipline of information theory and bringing it to immediate worldwide attention was the publication of Claude Shannon's classic paper \"A Mathematical Theory of Communication\" in the Bell System Technical Journal in July and October 1948. Historian James Gleick rated the paper as the most important development of 1948, noting that the paper was \"even more profound and more fundamental\" than the transistor.[27] He came to be known as the \"father of information theory\".[28][29][30] Shannon outlined some of his initial ideas of information theory as early as 1939 in a letter to Vannevar Bush.[30]\nPrior to this paper, limited information-theoretic ideas had been developed at Bell Labs, all implicitly assuming events of equal probability. Harry Nyquist's 1924 paper, Certain Factors Affecting Telegraph Speed, contains a theoretical section quantifying \"intelligence\" and the \"line speed\" at which it can be transmitted by a communication system, giving the relation W = K log m (recalling the Boltzmann constant), where W is the speed of transmission of intelligence, m is the number of different voltage levels to choose from at each time step, and K is a constant. Ralph Hartley's 1928 paper, Transmission of Information, uses the word information as a measurable quantity, reflecting the receiver's ability to distinguish one sequence of symbols from any other, thus quantifying information as H = log Sn = n log S, where S was the number of possible symbols, and n the number of symbols in a transmission. The unit of information was therefore the decimal digit, which since has sometimes been called the hartley in his honor as a unit or scale or measure of information. Alan Turing in 1940 used similar ideas as part of the statistical analysis of the breaking of the German second world war Enigma ciphers.[citation needed]\nMuch of the mathematics behind information theory with events of different probabilities were developed for the field of thermodynamics by Ludwig Boltzmann and J. Willard Gibbs. Connections between information-theoretic entropy and thermodynamic entropy, including the important contributions by Rolf Landauer in the 1960s, are explored in Entropy in thermodynamics and information theory.[citation needed]\nIn Shannon's revolutionary and groundbreaking paper, the work for which had been substantially completed at Bell Labs by the end of 1944, Shannon for the first time introduced the qualitative and quantitative model of communication as a statistical process underlying information theory, opening with the assertion:[31] \n\n\"The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point, either exactly or approximately, a message selected at another point.\"\nWith it came the ideas of: \n\nThe information entropy and redundancy of a source, and its relevance through the source coding theorem;\nThe mutual information, and the channel capacity of a noisy channel, including the promise of perfect loss-free communication given by the noisy-channel coding theorem;\nThe practical result of the Shannon–Hartley law for the channel capacity of a Gaussian channel; as well as\nThe bit—a new way of seeing the most fundamental unit of information.[citation needed]\nQuantities of information[edit]\n\nInformation theory is based on probability theory and statistics, where quantified information is usually described in terms of bits. Information theory often concerns itself with measures of information of the distributions associated with random variables. One of the most important measures is called entropy, which forms the building block of many other measures. Entropy allows quantification of measure of information in a single random variable.[32] \nAnother useful concept is mutual information defined on two random variables, which describes the measure of information in common between those variables, which can be used to describe their correlation. The former quantity is a property of the probability distribution of a random variable and gives a limit on the rate at which data generated by independent samples with the given distribution can be reliably compressed. The latter is a property of the joint distribution of two random variables, and is the maximum rate of reliable communication across a noisy channel in the limit of long block lengths, when the channel statistics are determined by the joint distribution.\nThe choice of logarithmic base in the following formulae determines the unit of information entropy that is used. A common unit of information is the bit or shannon, based on the binary logarithm. Other units include the nat, which is based on the natural logarithm, and the decimal digit, which is based on the common logarithm.\nIn what follows, an expression of the form p log p is considered by convention to be equal to zero whenever p = 0. This is justified because  for any logarithmic base.\n\nEntropy of an information source[edit]\nBased on the probability mass function of a source, the Shannon entropy H, in units of bits per symbol, is defined as the expected value of the information content of the symbols.[33][34]\nThe amount of information conveyed by an individual source symbol  with probability  is known as its self-information or surprisal, . This quantity is defined as:[35][36]\n\n\nA less probable symbol has a larger surprisal, meaning its occurrence provides more information.[35] The entropy  is the weighted average of the surprisal of all possible symbols from the source's probability distribution:[37][38]\n\n\nIntuitively, the entropy  of a discrete random variable X is a measure of the amount of uncertainty associated with the value of  when only its distribution is known.[33] A high entropy indicates the outcomes are more evenly distributed, making the result harder to predict.[39]\nFor example, if one transmits 1000 bits (0s and 1s), and the value of each of these bits is known to the receiver (has a specific value with certainty) ahead of transmission, no information is transmitted. If, however, each bit is independently and equally likely to be 0 or 1, 1000 shannons of information (more often called bits) have been transmitted.[40]\n\nThe entropy of a Bernoulli trial as a function of success probability, often called the binary entropy function, Hb(p). The entropy is maximized at 1 bit per trial when the two possible outcomes are equally probable, as in an unbiased coin toss.\n\nA key property of entropy is that it is maximized when all the messages in the message space are equiprobable. For a source with n possible symbols, where  for all , the entropy is given by:[41]\n\n\nThis maximum value represents the most unpredictable state.[37]\nFor a source that emits a sequence of  symbols that are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), the total entropy of the message is  bits. If the source data symbols are identically distributed but not independent, the entropy of a message of length  will be less than .[42][43]\n\n\nThe choice of the logarithmic base in the entropy formula determines the unit of entropy used:[35][37]\n\nA base-2 logarithm (as shown in the main formula) measures entropy in bits per symbol. This unit is also sometimes called the shannon in honor of Claude Shannon.[33]\nA Natural logarithm (base e) measures entropy in nats per symbol. This is often used in theoretical analysis as it avoids the need for scaling constants (like ln 2) in derivations.[44]\nOther bases are also possible. A base-10 logarithm measures entropy in decimal digits, or hartleys, per symbol.[34] A base-256 logarithm measures entropy in bytes per symbol, since 28 = 256.[45]\nBinary Entropy Function[edit]\nThe special case of information entropy for a random variable with two outcomes (a Bernoulli trial) is the binary entropy function. This is typically calculated using a base-2 logarithm, and its unit is the shannon.[46] If one outcome has probability p, the other has probability 1 − p. The entropy is given by:[47]\n\n\nThis function is depicted in the plot shown above, reaching its maximum of 1 bit when p = 0.5, corresponding to the highest uncertainty.\n\n\nThe joint entropy of two discrete random variables X and Y is merely the entropy of their pairing: (X, Y). This implies that if X and Y are independent, then their joint entropy is the sum of their individual entropies.\nFor example, if (X, Y) represents the position of a chess piece—X the row and Y the column, then the joint entropy of the row of the piece and the column of the piece will be the entropy of the position of the piece.\n\n\nDespite similar notation, joint entropy should not be confused with cross-entropy.\n\nConditional entropy (equivocation)[edit]\nThe conditional entropy or conditional uncertainty of X given random variable Y (also called the equivocation of X about Y) is the average conditional entropy over Y:[48]\n\n\nBecause entropy can be conditioned on a random variable or on that random variable being a certain value, care should be taken not to confuse these two definitions of conditional entropy, the former of which is in more common use. A basic property of this form of conditional entropy is that:\n\n\nMutual information (transinformation)[edit]\nMutual information measures the amount of information that can be obtained about one random variable by observing another. It is important in communication where it can be used to maximize the amount of information shared between sent and received signals. The mutual information of X relative to Y is given by:\n\n\nwhere SI (Specific mutual Information) is the pointwise mutual information.\nA basic property of the mutual information is that:\n\n\nThat is, knowing , we can save an average of I(X; Y) bits in encoding  compared to not knowing .\nMutual information is symmetric:\n\n\nMutual information can be expressed as the average Kullback–Leibler divergence (information gain) between the posterior probability distribution of  given the value of  and the prior distribution on :\n\n\nIn other words, this is a measure of how much, on the average, the probability distribution on  will change if we are given the value of . This is often recalculated as the divergence from the product of the marginal distributions to the actual joint distribution:\n\n\nMutual information is closely related to the log-likelihood ratio test in the context of contingency tables and the multinomial distribution and to Pearson's χ2 test: mutual information can be considered a statistic for assessing independence between a pair of variables, and has a well-specified asymptotic distribution.\n\nKullback–Leibler divergence (information gain)[edit]\nThe Kullback–Leibler divergence (or information divergence, information gain, or relative entropy) is a way of comparing two distributions: a \"true\" probability distribution ⁠⁠, and an arbitrary probability distribution ⁠⁠. If we compress data in a manner that assumes ⁠⁠ is the distribution underlying some data, when, in reality, ⁠⁠ is the correct distribution, the Kullback–Leibler divergence is the number of average additional bits per datum necessary for compression. It is thus defined\n\n\nAlthough it is sometimes used as a 'distance metric', KL divergence is not a true metric since it is not symmetric and does not satisfy the triangle inequality (making it a semi-quasimetric).\nAnother interpretation of the KL divergence is the \"unnecessary surprise\" introduced by a prior from the truth: suppose a number  is about to be drawn randomly from a discrete set with probability distribution ⁠⁠. If Alice knows the true distribution ⁠⁠, while Bob believes (has a prior) that the distribution is ⁠⁠, then Bob will be more surprised than Alice, on average, upon seeing the value of . The KL divergence is the (objective) expected value of Bob's (subjective) surprisal minus Alice's surprisal, measured in bits if the log is in base 2. In this way, the extent to which Bob's prior is \"wrong\" can be quantified in terms of how \"unnecessarily surprised\" it is expected to make him.\n\nDirected Information[edit]\nDirected information, , is an information theory measure that quantifies the information flow from the random process  to the random process . The term directed information was coined by James Massey and is defined as:\n\n,\nwhere  is the conditional mutual information .\nIn contrast to mutual information, directed information is not symmetric. The  measures the information bits that are transmitted causally[clarification needed] from  to . The Directed information has many applications in problems where causality plays an important role such as capacity of channel with feedback,[49][50] capacity of discrete memoryless networks with feedback,[51] gambling with causal side information,[52] compression with causal side information,[53]\nreal-time control communication settings,[54][55] and in statistical physics.[56]\n\n\nOther important information theoretic quantities include the Rényi entropy and the Tsallis entropy (generalizations of the concept of entropy), differential entropy (a generalization of quantities of information to continuous distributions), and the conditional mutual information. Also, pragmatic information has been proposed as a measure of how much information has been used in making a decision.\n\n\n\nA picture showing scratches on the readable surface of a CD-R. Music and data CDs are coded using error correcting codes and thus can still be read even if they have minor scratches using error detection and correction.\nCoding theory is one of the most important and direct applications of information theory. It can be subdivided into source coding theory and channel coding theory. Using a statistical description for data, information theory quantifies the number of bits needed to describe the data, which is the information entropy of the source.\n\nData compression (source coding): There are two formulations for the compression problem:\nLossless data compression: the data must be reconstructed exactly;\nLossy data compression: allocates bits needed to reconstruct the data, within a specified fidelity level measured by a distortion function. This subset of information theory is called rate–distortion theory.\nError-correcting codes (channel coding): While data compression removes as much redundancy as possible, an error-correcting code adds just the right kind of redundancy (i.e., error correction) needed to transmit the data efficiently and faithfully across a noisy channel.\nThis division of coding theory into compression and transmission is justified by the information transmission theorems, or source–channel separation theorems that justify the use of bits as the universal currency for information in many contexts. However, these theorems only hold in the situation where one transmitting user wishes to communicate to one receiving user. In scenarios with more than one transmitter (the multiple-access channel), more than one receiver (the broadcast channel) or intermediary \"helpers\" (the relay channel), or more general networks, compression followed by transmission may no longer be optimal.\n\n\nAny process that generates successive messages can be considered a source of information. A memoryless source is one in which each message is an independent identically distributed random variable, whereas the properties of ergodicity and stationarity impose less restrictive constraints. All such sources are stochastic. These terms are well studied in their own right outside information theory.\n\n\nInformation rate is the average entropy per symbol. For memoryless sources, this is merely the entropy of each symbol, while, in the case of a stationary stochastic process, it is:\n\n\nthat is, the conditional entropy of a symbol given all the previous symbols generated. For the more general case of a process that is not necessarily stationary, the average rate is:\n\n\nthat is, the limit of the joint entropy per symbol. For stationary sources, these two expressions give the same result.[57]\nThe information rate is defined as:  \n\n\nIt is common in information theory to speak of the \"rate\" or \"entropy\" of a language. This is appropriate, for example, when the source of information is English prose. The rate of a source of information is related to its redundancy and how well it can be compressed, the subject of source coding.\n\n\n\nCommunications over a channel is the primary motivation of information theory. However, channels often fail to produce exact reconstruction of a signal; noise, periods of silence, and other forms of signal corruption often degrade quality.\nConsider the communications process over a discrete channel. A simple model of the process is shown below:\n\n\nHere  represents the space of messages transmitted, and  the space of messages received during a unit time over our channel. Let p(y|x) be the conditional probability distribution function of  given . We will consider p(y|x) to be an inherent fixed property of our communications channel (representing the nature of the noise of our channel). Then the joint distribution of  and  is completely determined by our channel and by our choice of f(x), the marginal distribution of messages we choose to send over the channel. Under these constraints, we would like to maximize the rate of information, or the signal, we can communicate over the channel. The appropriate measure for this is the mutual information, and this maximum mutual information is called the channel capacity and is given by:\n\n\nThis capacity has the following property related to communicating at information rate R (where R is usually bits per symbol). For any information rate R < C and coding error ε > 0, for large enough N, there exists a code of length N and rate ≥ R and a decoding algorithm, such that the maximal probability of block error is ≤ ε; that is, it is always possible to transmit with arbitrarily small block error. In addition, for any rate R > C, it is impossible to transmit with arbitrarily small block error.\nChannel coding is concerned with finding such nearly optimal codes that can be used to transmit data over a noisy channel with a small coding error at a rate near the channel capacity.\n\nCapacity of particular channel models[edit]\nA continuous-time analog communications channel subject to Gaussian noise—see Shannon–Hartley theorem.\nA binary symmetric channel (BSC) with crossover probability p is a binary input, binary output channel that flips the input bit with probability p. The BSC has a capacity of 1 − Hb(p) bits per channel use, where Hb is the binary entropy function to the base-2 logarithm:\n\nA binary erasure channel (BEC) with erasure probability p is a binary input, ternary output channel. The possible channel outputs are 0, 1, and a third symbol 'e' called an erasure. The erasure represents complete loss of information about an input bit. The capacity of the BEC is 1 − p bits per channel use.\n\nChannels with memory and directed information[edit]\nIn practice many channels have memory. Namely, at time  the channel is given by the conditional probability.\nIt is often more comfortable to use the notation  and the channel become .\nIn such a case the capacity is given by the mutual information rate when there is no feedback available and the Directed information rate in the case that either there is feedback or not[49][58] (if there is no feedback the directed information equals the mutual information).\n\nFungible information[edit]\nFungible information is the information for which the means of encoding is not important.[59] Classical information theorists and computer scientists are mainly concerned with information of this sort. It is sometimes referred as speakable information.[60]\n\nApplications to other fields[edit]\nIntelligence uses and secrecy applications[edit]\n\nInformation theoretic concepts apply to cryptography and cryptanalysis. Turing's information unit, the ban, was used in the Ultra project, breaking the German Enigma machine code and hastening the end of World War II in Europe. Shannon himself defined an important concept now called the unicity distance. Based on the redundancy of the plaintext, it attempts to give a minimum amount of ciphertext necessary to ensure unique decipherability.\nInformation theory leads us to believe it is much more difficult to keep secrets than it might first appear. A brute force attack can break systems based on asymmetric key algorithms or on most commonly used methods of symmetric key algorithms (sometimes called secret key algorithms), such as block ciphers. The security of all such methods comes from the assumption that no known attack can break them in a practical amount of time.\nInformation theoretic security refers to methods such as the one-time pad that are not vulnerable to such brute force attacks. In such cases, the positive conditional mutual information between the plaintext and ciphertext (conditioned on the key) can ensure proper transmission, while the unconditional mutual information between the plaintext and ciphertext remains zero, resulting in absolutely secure communications. In other words, an eavesdropper would not be able to improve his or her guess of the plaintext by gaining knowledge of the ciphertext but not of the key. However, as in any other cryptographic system, care must be used to correctly apply even information-theoretically secure methods; the Venona project was able to crack the one-time pads of the Soviet Union due to their improper reuse of key material.\n\nPseudorandom number generation[edit]\n\nPseudorandom number generators are widely available in computer language libraries and application programs. They are, almost universally, unsuited to cryptographic use as they do not evade the deterministic nature of modern computer equipment and software. A class of improved random number generators is termed cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generators, but even they require random seeds external to the software to work as intended. These can be obtained via extractors, if done carefully. The measure of sufficient randomness in extractors is min-entropy, a value related to Shannon entropy through Rényi entropy; Rényi entropy is also used in evaluating randomness in cryptographic systems. Although related, the distinctions among these measures mean that a random variable with high Shannon entropy is not necessarily satisfactory for use in an extractor and so for cryptography uses.\n\nSeismic exploration[edit]\nOne early commercial application of information theory was in the field of seismic oil exploration. Work in this field made it possible to strip off and separate the unwanted noise from the desired seismic signal. Information theory and digital signal processing offer a major improvement of resolution and image clarity over previous analog methods.[61]\n\n\nSemioticians Doede Nauta (nl) and Winfried Nöth both considered Charles Sanders Peirce as having created a theory of information in his works on semiotics.[62]: 171 [63]: 137  Nauta defined semiotic information theory as the study of \"the internal processes of coding, filtering, and information processing.\"[62]: 91 \nConcepts from information theory such as redundancy and code control have been used by semioticians such as Umberto Eco and Ferruccio Rossi-Landi (it) to explain ideology as a form of message transmission whereby a dominant social class emits its message by using signs that exhibit a high degree of redundancy such that only one message is decoded among a selection of competing ones.[64]\n\nIntegrated process organization of neural information[edit]\nQuantitative information theoretic methods have been applied in cognitive science to analyze the integrated process organization of neural information in the context of the binding problem in cognitive neuroscience.[65] In this context, either an information-theoretical measure, such as functional clusters (Gerald Edelman and Giulio Tononi's functional clustering model and dynamic core hypothesis (DCH)[66]) or effective information (Tononi's integrated information theory (IIT) of consciousness[67][68][69]), is defined (on the basis of a reentrant process organization, i.e. the synchronization of neurophysiological activity between groups of neuronal populations), or the measure of the minimization of free energy on the basis of statistical methods (Karl J. Friston's free energy principle (FEP), an information-theoretical measure which states that every adaptive change in a self-organized system leads to a minimization of free energy, and the Bayesian brain hypothesis[70][71][72][73][74]).\n\nMiscellaneous applications[edit]\nInformation theory also has applications in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence,[75] black holes,[76] bioinformatics,[77] and gambling.[78][79]\n\n\n\n\nAlgorithmic probability\nBayesian inference\nCommunication theory\nConstructor theory – a generalization of information theory that includes quantum information\nFormal science\nInductive probability\nInfo-metrics\nMinimum message length\nMinimum description length\nPhilosophy of information\n\n\n\nActive networking\nCryptanalysis\nCryptography\nCybernetics\nEntropy in thermodynamics and information theory\nGambling\nIntelligence (information gathering)\nSeismic exploration\n\n\nHartley, R.V.L.\nHistory of information theory\nShannon, C.E.\nTimeline of information theory\nYockey, H.P.\nAndrey Kolmogorov\n\n\nCoding theory\nDetection theory\nEstimation theory\nFisher information\nInformation algebra\nInformation asymmetry\nInformation field theory\nInformation geometry\nInformation theory and measure theory\nKolmogorov complexity\nList of unsolved problems in information theory\nLogic of information\nNetwork coding\nPhilosophy of information\nQuantum information science\nSource coding\n\n\n\nBan (unit)\nChannel capacity\nCommunication channel\nCommunication source\nConditional entropy\nCovert channel\nData compression\nDecoder\nDifferential entropy\nFungible information\nInformation fluctuation complexity\nInformation entropy\nJoint entropy\nKullback–Leibler divergence\nMutual information\nPointwise mutual information (PMI)\nReceiver (information theory)\nRedundancy\nRényi entropy\nSelf-information\nUnicity distance\nVariety\nHamming distance\nPerplexity\n\n\n\n^ Schneider, Thomas D.

    "content": "This article is about scripting in Unix-like systems. For batch programming in DOS, OS/2 and Windows, see Batch file. For batch in Windows PowerShell, see Windows PowerShell § Scripting. For programming in the Windows NT/2000 command shell, see cmd.exe. For command procedures on VAX/VMS systems, see DIGITAL Command Language.\nEditing a FreeBSD shell script for configuring ipfirewall \nA shell script is a computer program designed to be run by a Unix shell, a command-line interpreter.[1] The various dialects of shell scripts are considered to be command languages. Typical operations performed by shell scripts include file manipulation, program execution, and printing text. A script which sets up the environment, runs the program, and does any necessary cleanup or logging, is called a wrapper.\nThe term is also used more generally to mean the automated mode of running an operating system shell; each operating system uses a particular name for these functions including batch files (MSDos-Win95 stream, OS/2), command procedures (VMS), and shell scripts (Windows NT stream and third-party derivatives like Take Command/4NT—article is at cmd.exe), and mainframe operating systems are associated with a number of terms.[2]\nAll Unix-like systems include at least one POSIX shell (typically either bash or the zsh compatibility mode),[3] while many also include a modern shell like fish or nushell.\n\n\n\n\nComments are ignored by the shell. They typically begin with the hash symbol (#), and continue until the end of the line.[4]\n\nConfigurable choice of scripting language[edit]\nThe shebang, or hash-bang, is a special kind of comment which the system uses to determine what interpreter to use to execute the file. The shebang consists of the characters \"#!\".[4] In Unix-like operating systems, the characters following the \"#!\" prefix are interpreted as a path to an executable program that will interpret the script.[5]\n\n\nA shell script can provide a convenient variation of a system command where special environment settings, command options, or post-processing apply automatically, but in a way that allows the new script to still act as a fully normal Unix command.\nOne example would be to create a version of ls, the command to list files, giving it a shorter command name of l, which would be normally saved in a user's bin directory as /home/username/bin/l, and a default set of command options pre-supplied.\n\n#!/bin/sh\nLC_COLLATE=C ls -FCas \"$@\"\n\nHere, the first line uses a shebang to indicate which interpreter should execute the rest of the script, and the second line makes a listing with options for file format indicators, columns, all files (none omitted), and a size in blocks. The LC_COLLATE=C sets the default collation order to not fold upper and lower case together, not intermix dotfiles with normal filenames as a side effect of ignoring punctuation in the names (dotfiles are usually only shown if an option like -a is used), and the \"$@\" causes any parameters given to l to pass through as parameters to ls, so that all of the normal options and other syntax known to ls can still be used.\nThe user could then simply use l for the most commonly used short listing.\nAnother example of a shell script that could be used as a shortcut would be to print a list of all the files and directories within a given directory.\n\n#!/bin/sh\n\nclear\nls -al\n\nIn this case, the shell script would start with its normal starting line of #!/bin/sh. Following this, the script executes the command clear which clears the terminal of all text before going to the next line. The following line provides the main function of the script. The ls -al command lists the files and directories that are in the directory from which the script is being run. The ls command attributes could be changed to reflect the needs of the user.\n\n\nShell scripts allow several commands that would be entered manually at a command-line interface to be executed automatically, and without having to wait for a user to trigger each stage of the sequence. For example, in a directory with three C source code files, rather than manually running the four commands required to build the final program from them, one could instead create a script for POSIX-compliant shells, here named build and kept in the directory with them, which would compile them automatically:\n\n#!/bin/sh\nprintf 'compiling...\\n'\ncc -c foo.c\ncc -c bar.c\ncc -c qux.c\ncc -o myprog foo.o bar.o qux.o\nprintf 'done.\\n'\n\nThe script would allow a user to save the file being edited, pause the editor, and then just run ./build to create the updated program, test it, and then return to the editor. Since the 1980s or so, however, scripts of this type have been replaced with utilities like make which are specialized for building programs.\n\n\nSimple batch jobs are not unusual for isolated tasks, but using shell loops, tests, and variables provides much more flexibility to users. A POSIX sh script to convert JPEG images to PNG images, where the image names are provided on the command-line—possibly via wildcards—instead of each being listed within the script, can be created with this file, typically saved in a file like /home/username/bin/jpg2png\n\n#!/bin/sh\nfor jpg; do                                  # use $jpg in place of each filename given, in turn\n    png=${jpg%.jpg}.png                      # construct the PNG version of the filename by replacing .jpg with .png\n    printf 'converting \"%s\" ...\\n' \"$jpg\"    # output status info to the user running the script\n    if convert \"$jpg\" jpg.to.png; then       # use convert (provided by ImageMagick) to create the PNG in a temp file\n        mv jpg.to.png \"$png\"                 # if it worked, rename the temporary PNG image to the correct name\n    else                                     # ...otherwise complain and exit from the script\n        printf >&2 'jpg2png: error: failed output saved in \"jpg.to.png\".\\n'\n        exit 1\n    fi                                       # the end of the \"if\" test construct\ndone                                         # the end of the \"for\" loop\nprintf 'all conversions successful\\n'        # tell the user the good news\n\nThe jpg2png command can then be run on an entire directory full of JPEG images with just /home/username/bin/jpg2png *.jpg\n\n\nMany modern shells also supply various features usually found only in more sophisticated general-purpose programming languages, such as control-flow constructs, variables, comments, arrays, subroutines and so on. With these sorts of features available, it is possible to write reasonably sophisticated applications as shell scripts. However, they are still limited by the fact that most shell languages have little or no support for data typing systems, classes, threading, complex math, and other common full language features, and are also generally much slower than compiled code or interpreted languages written with speed as a performance goal.\nThe standard Unix tools sed and awk provide extra capabilities for shell programming; Perl can also be embedded in shell scripts as can other scripting languages like Tcl.[6] Perl and Tcl come with graphics toolkits as well.\n\nTypical shell languages[edit]\n\nScripting languages commonly found on UNIX, Linux, and POSIX-compliant operating system installations include:\n\nThe original Bourne shell (sh), though no longer in common use\nGNU Bash (bash)\nDebian Almquist shell (dash)\nZ shell (zsh) if run in compatibility mode\nNon-POSIX shells in common use include:\n\nNushell (nu)\nFish shell (fish)\nxonsh shell (xonsh), pronounced \"conch\", a Python-based shell\nPowerShell (pwsh)\nThe C and Tcl shells have syntax quite similar to that of said programming languages, and the Korn shells and Bash are developments of the Bourne shell, which is based on the ALGOL language with elements of a number of others added as well.[7] On the other hand, the various shells plus tools like awk, sed, grep, and BASIC, Lisp, C and so forth contributed to the Perl programming language.[8]\nFormerly-popular shells include:\n\nOld shell (osh), a \"port of the standard command interpreter from Sixth Edition UNIX\"[9]\nKornShell (ksh), since mostly replaced by its successor the Z shell\nTenex C Shell (tcsh) and its predecessor the C shell (csh)\nRelated programs such as shells based on Python, Ruby, C, Java, Perl, Pascal, Rexx etc. in various forms are also widely available.\nSo called remote shells such as \n\na Remote Shell (rsh)\na Secure Shell (ssh)\nare really just tools to run a more complex shell on a remote system and have no 'shell' like characteristics themselves.\n\nOther scripting languages[edit]\n\nMany powerful scripting languages, such as Python, Perl, and Tcl, have been introduced to address tasks that are too large, complex, or repetitive to be comfortably handled by traditional shell scripts, while avoiding the overhead associated with compiled languages like C or Java.[10]\nAlthough the distinction between scripting languages and general-purpose high-level programming languages is often debated, scripting languages are typically characterized by their interpreted nature, simplified syntax, and primary use in automating tasks, coordinating system operations, and writing \"glue code\" between components.[11] Even when scripting languages such as Python or JavaScript support compilation to bytecode or use JIT to improve performance, they are still commonly referred to as \"scripting languages\" due to their historical association with automation, lightweight tooling, and scripting environments rather than standalone application development.\nImportantly, scripting is a form of programming. While \"scripting\" may emphasize lightweight, task-oriented automation, the broader term \"programming\" encompasses both scripting and software development in compiled or structured languages. As such, scripting involves writing code to instruct a computer to perform specific tasks—meeting the fundamental definition of programming.[12]\n\n\nShell scripts often serve as an initial stage in software development, and are often subject to conversion later to a different underlying implementation, most commonly being converted to Perl, Python, or C. The interpreter directive allows the implementation detail to be fully hidden inside the script, rather than being exposed as a filename extension, and provides for seamless reimplementation in different languages with no impact on end users.\nWhile files with the \".sh\" file extension are usually a shell script of some kind, most shell scripts do not have any filename extension.[13][14][15][16]\n\nAdvantages and disadvantages[edit]\nPerhaps the biggest advantage of writing a shell script is that the commands and syntax are exactly the same as those directly entered at the command-line. The programmer does not have to switch to a totally different syntax, as they would if the script were written in a different language, or if a compiled language were used.\nOften, writing a shell script is much quicker than writing the equivalent code in other programming languages. The many advantages include easy program or file selection, quick start, and interactive debugging. A shell script can be used to provide a sequencing and decision-making linkage around existing programs, and for moderately sized scripts the absence of a compilation step is an advantage. Interpretive running makes it easy to write debugging code into a script and re-run it to detect and fix bugs. Non-expert users can use scripting to tailor the behavior of programs, and shell scripting provides some limited scope for multiprocessing.\nOn the other hand, shell scripting is prone to costly errors. Inadvertent typing errors such as rm -rf * / (instead of the intended rm -rf */) are folklore in the Unix community; a single extra space converts the command from one that deletes all subdirectories contained in the current directory, to one which deletes everything from the file system's root directory.[17] Similar problems can transform cp and mv into dangerous weapons, and misuse of the > redirect can delete the contents of a file.[18]\nAnother significant disadvantage is the slow execution speed and the need to launch a new process for almost every shell command executed. When a script's job can be accomplished by setting up a pipeline in which efficient filter commands perform most of the work, the slowdown is mitigated, but a complex script is typically several orders of magnitude slower than a conventional compiled program that performs an equivalent task.\nThere are also compatibility problems between different platforms. Larry Wall, creator of Perl, famously wrote that \"It's easier to port a shell than a shell script.\"[19]\nSimilarly, more complex scripts can run into the limitations of the shell scripting language itself; the limits make it difficult to write quality code, and extensions by various shells to ameliorate problems with the original shell language can make problems worse.[20]\nMany disadvantages of using some script languages are caused by design flaws within the language syntax or implementation, and are not necessarily imposed by the use of a text-based command-line; there are a number of shells which use other shell programming languages or even full-fledged languages like Scsh (which uses Scheme).\n\nInteroperability among scripting languages[edit]\nMany scripting languages share similar syntax and features due to their adherence to the POSIX standard, and several shells provide modes to emulate or maintain compatibility with others. This allows scripts written for one shell to often run in another with minimal changes.\nFor example, Bash supports much of the original Bourne shell syntax and offers a POSIX-compliant mode to improve portability. However, Bash also includes a number of extensions not found in POSIX, commonly referred to as bashisms[broken anchor]. While these features enhance scripting capabilities, they may reduce compatibility with other shells like Dash or ksh.\n\nShell scripting on other operating systems[edit]\nInteroperability software such as Cygwin, the MKS Toolkit, Interix (formerly part of Microsoft Windows Services for UNIX), Hamilton C shell, and UWIN (AT&T Unix for Windows) enables Unix shell programs to run on Windows NT-based systems, though some features may not be fully supported on the older MS-DOS/Windows 95 platforms. Earlier versions of the MKS Toolkit also provided support for OS/2. \nIn addition, several DCL (Digital Command Language) implementations are available for Windows environments. These include scripting tools like XLNT, which integrates with the Windows command shell and supports automation for CGI programming and Windows Script Host. macOS (formerly Mac OS X) is also Unix-based and includes a POSIX-compliant shell environment by default.[21]\nThe console alternatives 4DOS, 4OS2, FreeDOS, Peter Norton's NDOS and Take Command (formerly 4NT) which add functionality to the Windows NT-style cmd.exe, MS-DOS/Windows 95 batch files (run by Command.com), OS/2's cmd.exe, and 4NT respectively are similar to the shells that they enhance and are more integrated with the Windows Script Host, which comes with three pre-installed engines, VBScript, JScript, and VBA and to which numerous third-party engines can be added, with Rexx, Perl, Python, Ruby, and Tcl having pre-defined functions in 4NT and related programs. PC DOS is quite similar to MS-DOS, whilst DR DOS is more different. Earlier versions of Windows NT are able to run contemporary versions of 4OS2 by the OS/2 subsystem.\nScripting languages are, by definition, able to be extended; for example, a MS-DOS/Windows 95/98 and Windows NT type systems allows for shell/batch programs to call tools like KiXtart, QBasic, various BASIC, Rexx, Perl, and Python implementations, the Windows Script Host and its installed engines. On Unix and other POSIX-compliant systems, awk and sed are used to extend the string and numeric processing ability of shell scripts. Tcl, Perl, Rexx, and Python have graphics toolkits and can be used to code functions and procedures for shell scripts which pose a speed bottleneck (C, Fortran, assembly language &c are much faster still) and to add functionality not available in the shell language such as sockets and other connectivity functions, heavy-duty text processing, working with numbers if the calling script does not have those abilities, self-writing and self-modifying code, techniques like recursion, direct memory access, various types of sorting and more, which are difficult or impossible in the main script, and so on. Visual Basic for Applications and VBScript can be used to control and communicate with such things as spreadsheets, databases, scriptable programs of all types, telecommunications software, development tools, graphics tools and other software which can be accessed through the Component Object Model.\n\n\nGlue code\nInterpreter directive\nShebang symbol (#!)\nUnix shells\nPowerShell\nWindows Script Host\n\n\n^ Kernighan, Brian W.; Pike, Rob (1984), \"3.

Language processing is considered to be a uniquely human ability that is not produced with the same grammatical understanding or systematicity in even human's closest primate relatives.[1]\nThroughout the 20th century the dominant model[2] for language processing in the brain was the Geschwind–Lichteim–Wernicke model, which is based primarily on the analysis of brain-damaged patients. However, due to improvements in intra-cortical electrophysiological recordings of  monkey and human brains, as well non-invasive techniques such as fMRI, PET, MEG and EEG, an auditory pathway consisting of two parts[3][4] has been revealed and a two-streams model has been developed. In accordance with this model, there are two pathways that connect the auditory cortex to the frontal lobe, each pathway accounting for different linguistic roles. The auditory ventral stream pathway is responsible for sound recognition, and is accordingly known as the auditory 'what' pathway. The auditory dorsal stream in both humans and non-human primates is responsible for sound localization, and is accordingly known as the auditory 'where' pathway. In humans, this pathway (especially in the left hemisphere) is also responsible for speech production, speech repetition, lip-reading, and phonological working memory and long-term memory. In accordance with the 'from where to what' model of language evolution,[5][6] the reason the ADS is characterized with such a broad range of functions is that each indicates a different stage in language evolution.\nThe division of the two streams first occurs in the auditory nerve where the anterior branch enters the anterior cochlear nucleus in the brainstem which gives rise to the auditory ventral stream.  The posterior branch enters the dorsal and posteroventral cochlear nucleus to give rise to the auditory dorsal stream.[7]: 8 \nLanguage processing can also occur in relation to signed languages or written content.\n\n\nEarly neurolinguistics models[edit]\nLanguage Areas of the human brain. The angular gyrus is represented in orange, supramarginal gyrus is represented in yellow, Broca's area is represented in blue, Wernicke's area is represented in green and the primary auditory cortex is represented in pink.\nThroughout the 20th century, our knowledge of language processing in the brain was dominated by the Wernicke–Lichtheim–Geschwind model.[8][2][9] The Wernicke–Lichtheim–Geschwind model is primarily based on research conducted on brain-damaged individuals who were reported to possess a variety of language related disorders. In accordance with this model, words are perceived via a specialized word reception center (Wernicke's area) that is located in the left temporoparietal junction. This region then projects to a word production center (Broca's area) that is located in the left inferior frontal gyrus. Because almost all language input was thought to funnel via Wernicke's area and all language output to funnel via Broca's area, it became extremely difficult to identify the basic properties of each region. This lack of clear definition for the contribution of Wernicke's and Broca's regions to human language rendered it extremely difficult to identify their homologues in other primates.[10] With the advent of the fMRI and its application for lesion mappings, however, it was shown that this model is based on incorrect correlations between symptoms and lesions.[11][12][13][14][15][16][17] The refutation of such an influential and dominant model opened the door to new models of language processing in the brain.\n\nCurrent neurolinguistics models[edit]\n\nIn the last two decades, significant advances occurred in our understanding of the neural processing of sounds in primates. Initially by recording of neural activity in the auditory cortices of monkeys[18][19] and later elaborated via histological staining[20][21][22] and fMRI scanning studies,[23] 3 auditory fields were identified in the primary auditory cortex, and 9 associative auditory fields were shown to surround them (Figure 1 top left). Anatomical tracing and lesion studies further indicated of a separation between the anterior and posterior auditory fields, with the anterior primary auditory fields (areas R-RT) projecting to the anterior associative auditory fields (areas AL-RTL), and the posterior primary auditory field (area A1) projecting to the posterior associative auditory fields (areas CL-CM).[20][24][25][26] Recently, evidence accumulated that indicates homology between the human and monkey auditory fields. In humans, histological staining studies revealed two separate auditory fields in the primary auditory region of Heschl's gyrus,[27][28] and by mapping the tonotopic organization of the human primary auditory fields with high resolution fMRI and comparing it to the tonotopic organization of the monkey primary auditory fields, homology was established between the human anterior primary auditory field and monkey area R (denoted in humans as area hR) and the human posterior primary auditory field and the monkey area A1 (denoted in humans as area hA1).[29][30][31][32][33] Intra-cortical recordings from the human auditory cortex further demonstrated similar patterns of connectivity to the auditory cortex of the monkey. Recording from the surface of the auditory cortex (supra-temporal plane) reported that the anterior Heschl's gyrus (area hR) projects primarily to the middle-anterior superior temporal gyrus (mSTG-aSTG) and the posterior Heschl's gyrus (area hA1) projects primarily to the posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG) and the planum temporale (area PT; Figure 1 top right).[34][35] Consistent with connections from area hR to the aSTG and hA1 to the pSTG is an fMRI study of a patient with impaired sound recognition (auditory agnosia), who was shown with reduced bilateral activation in areas hR and aSTG but with spared activation in the mSTG-pSTG.[36] This connectivity pattern is also corroborated by a study that recorded activation from the lateral surface of the auditory cortex and reported of simultaneous non-overlapping activation clusters in the pSTG and mSTG-aSTG while listening to sounds.[37]\nDownstream to the auditory cortex, anatomical tracing studies in monkeys delineated projections from the anterior associative auditory fields (areas AL-RTL) to ventral prefrontal and premotor cortices in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG)[38][39] and amygdala.[40] Cortical recording and functional imaging studies in macaque monkeys further elaborated on this processing stream by showing that acoustic information flows from the anterior auditory cortex to the temporal pole (TP) and then to the IFG.[41][42][43][44][45][46] This pathway is commonly referred to as the auditory ventral stream (AVS; Figure 1, bottom left-red arrows). In contrast to the anterior auditory fields, tracing studies reported that the posterior auditory fields (areas CL-CM) project primarily to dorsolateral prefrontal and premotor cortices (although some projections do terminate in the IFG.[47][39] Cortical recordings and anatomical tracing studies in monkeys further provided evidence that this processing stream flows from the posterior auditory fields to the frontal lobe via a relay station in the intra-parietal sulcus (IPS).[48][49][50][51][52][53] This pathway is commonly referred to as the auditory dorsal stream (ADS; Figure 1, bottom left-blue arrows). Comparing the white matter pathways involved in communication in humans and monkeys with diffusion tensor imaging techniques indicates of similar connections of the AVS and ADS in the two species (Monkey,[52] Human[54][55][56][57][58][59]). In humans, the pSTG was shown to project to the parietal lobe (sylvian parietal-temporal junction-inferior parietal lobule; Spt-IPL), and from there to dorsolateral prefrontal and premotor cortices (Figure 1, bottom right-blue arrows), and the aSTG was shown to project to the anterior temporal lobe (middle temporal gyrus-temporal pole; MTG-TP) and from there to the IFG (Figure 1 bottom right-red arrows).\n\n Auditory ventral stream[edit]\nThe auditory ventral stream (AVS) connects the auditory cortex with the middle temporal gyrus and temporal pole, which in turn connects with the inferior frontal gyrus. This pathway is responsible for sound recognition, and is accordingly known as the auditory 'what' pathway. The functions of the AVS include the following.\n\n\nAccumulative converging evidence indicates that the AVS is involved in recognizing auditory objects. At the level of the primary auditory cortex, recordings from monkeys showed higher percentage of neurons selective for learned melodic sequences in area R than area A1,[60] and a study in humans demonstrated more selectivity for heard syllables in the anterior Heschl's gyrus (area hR) than posterior Heschl's gyrus (area hA1).[61] In downstream associative auditory fields, studies from both monkeys and humans reported that the border between the anterior and posterior auditory fields (Figure 1-area PC in the monkey and mSTG in the human) processes pitch attributes that are necessary for the recognition of auditory objects.[18] The anterior auditory fields of monkeys were also demonstrated with selectivity for con-specific vocalizations with intra-cortical recordings.[41][19][62] and functional imaging[63][42][43] One fMRI monkey study further demonstrated a role of the aSTG in the recognition of individual voices.[42] The role of the human mSTG-aSTG in sound recognition was demonstrated via functional imaging studies that correlated activity in this region with isolation of auditory objects from background noise,[64][65] and with the recognition of spoken words,[66][67][68][69][70][71][72] voices,[73] melodies,[74][75] environmental sounds,[76][77][78] and non-speech communicative sounds.[79] A meta-analysis of fMRI studies[80] further demonstrated functional dissociation between the left mSTG and aSTG, with the former processing short speech units (phonemes) and the latter processing longer units (e.g., words, environmental sounds). A study that recorded neural activity directly from the left pSTG and aSTG reported that the aSTG, but not pSTG, was more active when the patient listened to speech in her native language than unfamiliar foreign language.[81] Consistently, electro stimulation to the aSTG of this patient resulted in impaired speech perception[81] (see also[82][83] for similar results). Intra-cortical recordings from the right and left aSTG further demonstrated that speech is processed laterally to music.[81] An fMRI study of a patient with impaired sound recognition (auditory agnosia) due to brainstem damage was also shown with reduced activation in areas hR and aSTG of both hemispheres when hearing spoken words and environmental sounds.[36] Recordings from the anterior auditory cortex of monkeys while maintaining learned sounds in working memory,[46] and the debilitating effect of induced lesions to this region on working memory recall,[84][85][86] further implicate the AVS in maintaining the perceived auditory objects in working memory. In humans, area mSTG-aSTG was also reported active during rehearsal of heard syllables with MEG.[87] and fMRI[88] The latter study further demonstrated that working memory in the AVS is for the acoustic properties of spoken words and that it is independent to working memory in the ADS, which mediates inner speech. Working memory studies in monkeys also suggest that in monkeys, in contrast to humans, the AVS is the dominant working memory store.[89]\nIn humans, downstream to the aSTG, the MTG and TP are thought to constitute the semantic lexicon, which is a long-term memory repository of audio-visual representations that are interconnected on the basis of semantic relationships. (See also the reviews by[3][4] discussing this topic). The primary evidence for this role of the MTG-TP is that patients with damage to this region (e.g., patients with semantic dementia or herpes simplex virus encephalitis) are reported[90][91] with an impaired ability to describe visual and auditory objects and a tendency to commit semantic errors when naming objects (i.e., semantic paraphasia). Semantic paraphasias were also expressed by aphasic patients with left MTG-TP damage[14][92] and were shown to occur in non-aphasic patients after electro-stimulation to this region.[93][83] or the underlying white matter pathway[94] Two meta-analyses of the fMRI literature also reported that the anterior MTG and TP were consistently active during semantic analysis of speech and text;[66][95] and an intra-cortical recording study correlated neural discharge in the MTG with the comprehension of intelligible sentences.[96]\n\nSentence comprehension[edit]\nIn addition to extracting meaning from sounds, the MTG-TP region of the AVS appears to have a role in sentence comprehension, possibly by merging concepts together (e.g., merging the concept 'blue' and 'shirt' to create the concept of a 'blue shirt'). The role of the MTG in extracting meaning from sentences has been demonstrated in functional imaging studies reporting stronger activation in the anterior MTG when proper sentences are contrasted with lists of words, sentences in a foreign or nonsense language, scrambled sentences, sentences with semantic or syntactic violations and sentence-like sequences of environmental sounds.[97][98][99][100][101][102][103][104] One fMRI study[105] in which participants were instructed to read a story further correlated activity in the anterior MTG with the amount of semantic and syntactic content each sentence contained. An EEG study[106] that contrasted cortical activity while reading sentences with and without syntactic violations in healthy participants and patients with MTG-TP damage, concluded that the MTG-TP in both hemispheres participate in the automatic (rule based) stage of syntactic analysis (ELAN component), and that the left MTG-TP is also involved in a later controlled stage of syntax analysis (P600 component). Patients with damage to the MTG-TP region have also been reported with impaired sentence comprehension.[14][107][108] See review[109] for more information on this topic.\n\n\nIn contradiction to the Wernicke–Lichtheim–Geschwind model that implicates sound recognition to occur solely in the left hemisphere, studies that examined the properties of the right or left hemisphere in isolation via unilateral hemispheric anesthesia (i.e., the WADA procedure[110]) or intra-cortical recordings from each hemisphere[96] provided evidence that sound recognition is processed bilaterally. Moreover, a study that instructed patients with disconnected hemispheres (i.e., split-brain patients) to match spoken words to written words presented to the right or left hemifields, reported vocabulary in the right hemisphere that almost matches in size with the left hemisphere[111] (The right hemisphere vocabulary was equivalent to the vocabulary of a healthy 11-years old child). This bilateral recognition of sounds is also consistent with the finding that unilateral lesion to the auditory cortex rarely results in deficit to auditory comprehension (i.e., auditory agnosia), whereas a second lesion to the remaining hemisphere (which could occur years later) does.[112][113] Finally, as mentioned earlier, an fMRI scan of an auditory agnosia patient demonstrated bilateral reduced activation in the anterior auditory cortices,[36] and bilateral electro-stimulation to these regions in both hemispheres resulted with impaired speech recognition.[81]\n\n Auditory dorsal stream[edit]\nThe auditory dorsal stream connects the auditory cortex with the parietal lobe, which in turn connects with inferior frontal gyrus. In both humans and non-human primates, the auditory dorsal stream is responsible for sound localization, and is accordingly known as the auditory 'where' pathway. In humans, this pathway (especially in the left hemisphere) is also responsible for speech production, speech repetition, lip-reading, and phonological working memory and long-term memory. \n\n\nStudies of present-day humans have demonstrated a role for the ADS in speech production, particularly in the vocal expression of the names of objects. For instance, in a series of studies in which sub-cortical fibers were directly stimulated[94] interference in the left pSTG and IPL resulted in errors during object-naming tasks, and interference in the left IFG resulted in speech arrest. Magnetic interference in the pSTG and IFG of healthy participants also produced speech errors and speech arrest, respectively[114][115] One study has also reported that electrical stimulation of the left IPL caused patients to believe that they had spoken when they had not and that IFG stimulation caused patients to unconsciously move their lips.[116] The contribution of the ADS to the process of articulating the names of objects could be dependent on the reception of afferents from the semantic lexicon of the AVS, as an intra-cortical recording study reported of activation in the posterior MTG prior to activation in the Spt-IPL region when patients named objects in pictures[117] Intra-cortical electrical stimulation studies also reported that electrical interference to the posterior MTG was correlated with impaired object naming[118][82]\nAdditionally, lesion studies of stroke patients have provided evidence supporting the dual stream model's role in speech production. Recent research using multivariate lesion/disconnectome symptom mapping has shown that lower scores in speech production tasks are associated with lesions and abnormalities in the left inferior parietal lobe and frontal lobe. These findings from stroke patients further support the involvement of the dorsal stream pathway in speech production, complementing the stimulation and interference studies in healthy participants.[119]\n\n\nAlthough sound perception is primarily ascribed with the AVS, the ADS appears associated with several aspects of speech perception. For instance, in a meta-analysis of fMRI studies[120] (Turkeltaub and Coslett, 2010), in which the auditory perception of phonemes was contrasted with closely matching sounds, and the studies were rated for the required level of attention, the authors concluded that attention to phonemes correlates with strong activation in the pSTG-pSTS region. An intra-cortical recording study in which participants were instructed to identify syllables also correlated the hearing of each syllable with its own activation pattern in the pSTG.[121] The involvement of the ADS in both speech perception and production has been further illuminated in several pioneering functional imaging studies that contrasted speech perception with overt or covert speech production.[122][123][124] These studies demonstrated that the pSTS is active only during the perception of speech, whereas area Spt is active during both the perception and production of speech. The authors concluded that the pSTS projects to area Spt, which converts the auditory input into articulatory movements.[125][126] Similar results have been obtained in a study in which participants' temporal and parietal lobes were electrically stimulated. This study reported that electrically stimulating the pSTG region interferes with sentence comprehension and that stimulation of the IPL interferes with the ability to vocalize the names of objects.[83] The authors also reported that stimulation in area Spt and the inferior IPL induced interference during both object-naming and speech-comprehension tasks. The role of the ADS in speech repetition is also congruent with the results of the other functional imaging studies that have localized activation during speech repetition tasks to ADS regions.[127][128][129] An intra-cortical recording study that recorded activity throughout most of the temporal, parietal and frontal lobes also reported activation in the pSTG, Spt, IPL and IFG when speech repetition is contrasted with speech perception.[130] Neuropsychological studies have also found that individuals with speech repetition deficits but preserved auditory comprehension (i.e., conduction aphasia) suffer from circumscribed damage to the Spt-IPL area[131][132][133][134][135][136][137] or damage to the projections that emanate from this area and target the frontal lobe[138][139][140][141] Studies have also reported a transient speech repetition deficit in patients after direct intra-cortical electrical stimulation to this same region.[11][142][143] Insight into the purpose of speech repetition in the ADS is provided by longitudinal studies of children that correlated the learning of foreign vocabulary with the ability to repeat nonsense words.[144][145]\n\n\nIn addition to repeating and producing speech, the ADS appears to have a role in monitoring the quality of the speech output. Neuroanatomical evidence suggests that the ADS is equipped with descending connections from the IFG to the pSTG that relay information about motor activity (i.e., corollary discharges) in the vocal apparatus (mouth, tongue, vocal folds). This feedback marks the sound perceived during speech production as self-produced and can be used to adjust the vocal apparatus to increase the similarity between the perceived and emitted calls. Evidence for descending connections from the IFG to the pSTG has been offered by a study that electrically stimulated the IFG during surgical operations and reported the spread of activation to the pSTG-pSTS-Spt region[146] A study[147] that compared the ability of aphasic patients with frontal, parietal or temporal lobe damage to quickly and repeatedly articulate a string of syllables reported that damage to the frontal lobe interfered with the articulation of both identical syllabic strings (\"Bababa\") and non-identical syllabic strings (\"Badaga\"), whereas patients with temporal or parietal lobe damage only exhibited impairment when articulating non-identical syllabic strings. Because the patients with temporal and parietal lobe damage were capable of repeating the syllabic string in the first task, their speech perception and production appears to be relatively preserved, and their deficit in the second task is therefore due to impaired monitoring. Demonstrating the role of the descending ADS connections in monitoring emitted calls, an fMRI study instructed participants to speak under normal conditions or when hearing a modified version of their own voice (delayed first formant) and reported that hearing a distorted version of one's own voice results in increased activation in the pSTG.[148] Further demonstrating that the ADS facilitates motor feedback during mimicry is an intra-cortical recording study that contrasted speech perception and repetition.[130] The authors reported that, in addition to activation in the IPL and IFG, speech repetition is characterized by stronger activation in the pSTG than during speech perception.\n\nIntegration of phonemes with lip-movements[edit]\nAlthough sound perception is primarily ascribed with the AVS, the ADS appears associated with several aspects of speech perception. For instance, in a meta-analysis of fMRI studies[120] in which the auditory perception of phonemes was contrasted with closely matching sounds, and the studies were rated for the required level of attention, the authors concluded that attention to phonemes correlates with strong activation in the pSTG-pSTS region. An intra-cortical recording study in which participants were instructed to identify syllables also correlated the hearing of each syllable with its own activation pattern in the pSTG.[149] Consistent with the role of the ADS in discriminating phonemes,[120] studies have ascribed the integration of phonemes and their corresponding lip movements (i.e., visemes) to the pSTS of the ADS. For example, an fMRI study[150] has correlated activation in the pSTS with the McGurk illusion (in which hearing the syllable \"ba\" while seeing the viseme \"ga\" results in the perception of the syllable \"da\"). Another study has found that using magnetic stimulation to interfere with processing in this area further disrupts the McGurk illusion.[151] The association of the pSTS with the audio-visual integration of speech has also been demonstrated in a study that presented participants with pictures of faces and spoken words of varying quality. The study reported that the pSTS selects for the combined increase of the clarity of faces and spoken words.[152] Corroborating evidence has been provided by an fMRI study[153] that contrasted the perception of audio-visual speech with audio-visual non-speech (pictures and sounds of tools). This study reported the detection of speech-selective compartments in the pSTS. In addition, an fMRI study[154] that contrasted congruent audio-visual speech with incongruent speech (pictures of still faces) reported pSTS activation. For a review presenting additional converging evidence regarding the role of the pSTS and ADS in phoneme-viseme integration see.[155]\nEmpirical research has demonstrated that visual lip movements enhance speech processing along the auditory dorsal stream, particularly in noisy conditions. Recent studies [156] discovered that the dorsal stream regions, including frontal speech motor areas and supramarginal gyrus, show improved neural representations of speech sounds when visual lip movements are available.\n\nPhonological long-term memory[edit]\nA growing body of evidence indicates that humans, in addition to having a long-term store for word meanings located in the MTG-TP of the AVS (i.e., the semantic lexicon), also have a long-term store for the names of objects located in the Spt-IPL region of the ADS (i.e., the phonological lexicon). For example, a study[157][158] examining patients with damage to the AVS (MTG damage) or damage to the ADS (IPL damage) reported that MTG damage results in individuals incorrectly identifying objects (e.g., calling a \"goat\" a \"sheep,\" an example of semantic paraphasia). Conversely, IPL damage results in individuals correctly identifying the object but incorrectly pronouncing its name (e.g., saying \"gof\" instead of \"goat,\" an example of phonemic paraphasia). Semantic paraphasia errors have also been reported in patients receiving intra-cortical electrical stimulation of the AVS (MTG), and phonemic paraphasia errors have been reported in patients whose ADS (pSTG, Spt, and IPL) received intra-cortical electrical stimulation.[83][159][94] Further supporting the role of the ADS in object naming is an MEG study that localized activity in the IPL during the learning and during the recall of object names.[160] A study that induced magnetic interference in participants' IPL while they answered questions about an object reported that the participants were capable of answering questions regarding the object's characteristics or perceptual attributes but were impaired when asked whether the word contained two or three syllables.[161] An MEG study has also correlated recovery from anomia (a disorder characterized by an impaired ability to name objects) with changes in IPL activation.[162] Further supporting the role of the IPL in encoding the sounds of words are studies reporting that, compared to monolinguals, bilinguals have greater cortical density in the IPL but not the MTG.[163][164] Because evidence shows that, in bilinguals, different phonological representations of the same word share the same semantic representation,[165] this increase in density in the IPL verifies the existence of the phonological lexicon: the semantic lexicon of bilinguals is expected to be similar in size to the semantic lexicon of monolinguals, whereas their phonological lexicon should be twice the size. Consistent with this finding, cortical density in the IPL of monolinguals also correlates with vocabulary size.[166][167] Notably, the functional dissociation of the AVS and ADS in object-naming tasks is supported by cumulative evidence from reading research showing that semantic errors are correlated with MTG impairment and phonemic errors with IPL impairment. Based on these associations, the semantic analysis of text has been linked to the inferior-temporal gyrus and MTG, and the phonological analysis of text has been linked to the pSTG-Spt- IPL[168][169][170]\n\nPhonological working memory[edit]\nWorking memory is often treated as the temporary activation of the representations stored in long-term memory that are used for speech (phonological representations). This sharing of resources between working memory and speech is evident by the finding[171][172] that speaking during rehearsal results in a significant reduction in the number of items that can be recalled from working memory (articulatory suppression). The involvement of the phonological lexicon in working memory is also evidenced by the tendency of individuals to make more errors when recalling words from a recently learned list of phonologically similar words than from a list of phonologically dissimilar words (the phonological similarity effect).[171] Studies have also found that speech errors committed during reading are remarkably similar to speech errors made during the recall of recently learned, phonologically similar words from working memory.[173] Patients with IPL damage have also been observed to exhibit both speech production errors and impaired working memory[174][175][176][177] Finally, the view that verbal working memory is the result of temporarily activating phonological representations in the ADS is compatible with recent models describing working memory as the combination of maintaining representations in the mechanism of attention in parallel to temporarily activating representations in long-term memory.[172][178][179][180] It has been argued that the role of the ADS in the rehearsal of lists of words is the reason this pathway is active during sentence comprehension[181] For a review of the role of the ADS in working memory, see.[182]\nStudies have shown that performance on phonological working memory tasks correlates with properties of the left dorsal branch of the arcuate fasciculus (AF), which connects posterior temporal language regions with attention-regulating areas in the middle frontal gyrus. The arcuate fasciculus is a white matter pathway in the brain which contains two branches: a ventral branch connecting Wernicke's area with Broca's area and a dorsal branch connecting the posterior temporal region with the middle frontal gyrus. This dorsal branch appears to be particularly important for phonological working memory processes.[183]\n\nThe 'from where to what' model of language evolution hypotheses 7 stages of language evolution.\nLinguistic theories[edit]\nLanguage-processing research informs theories of language. The primary theoretical question is whether linguistic structures follow from the brain structures or vice versa. Externalist models, such as Ferdinand de Saussure's structuralism, argue that language as a social phenomenon is external to the brain. The individual receives the linguistic system from the outside, and the given language shapes the individual's brain.[184]\nThis idea is opposed by internalist models including Noam Chomsky's transformational generative grammar, George Lakoff's Cognitive Linguistics, and John A. Hawkins's efficiency hypothesis. According to Chomsky, language is acquired from an innate brain structure independently of meaning.[185] Lakoff argues that language emerges from the sensory systems.[186] Hawkins hypothesizes that cross-linguistically prevalent patterns are based on the brain's natural processing preferences.[187]\nAdditionally, models inspired by Richard Dawkins's memetics, including Construction Grammar and Usage-Based Linguistics, advocate a two-way model arguing that the brain shapes language, and language shapes the brain.[188][189]\nEvidence from neuroimaging studies points towards the externalist position. ERP studies suggest that language processing is based on the interaction of syntax and semantics, and the research does not support innate grammatical structures.[190][191] MRI studies suggest that the structural characteristics of the child's first language shapes the processing connectome of the brain.[192] Processing research has failed to find support for the inverse idea that syntactic structures reflect the brain's natural processing preferences cross-linguistically.[193]\n\nThe evolution of language[edit]\nThe auditory dorsal stream also has non-language related functions, such as sound localization[194][195][196][197][198] and guidance of eye movements.[199][200] Recent studies also indicate a role of the ADS in localization of family/tribe members, as a study[201] that recorded from the cortex of an epileptic patient reported that the pSTG, but not aSTG, is selective for the presence of new speakers. An fMRI[202] study of fetuses at their third trimester also demonstrated that area Spt is more selective to female speech than pure tones, and a sub-section of Spt is selective to the speech of their mother in contrast to unfamiliar female voices.\nIt is presently unknown why so many functions are ascribed to the human ADS. An attempt to unify these functions under a single framework was conducted in the 'From where to what' model of language evolution[203][204] In accordance with this model, each function of the ADS indicates of a different intermediate phase in the evolution of language. The roles of sound localization and integration of sound location with voices and auditory objects is interpreted as evidence that the origin of speech is the exchange of contact calls (calls used to report location in cases of separation) between mothers and offspring. The role of the ADS in the perception and production of intonations is interpreted as evidence that speech began by modifying the contact calls with intonations, possibly for distinguishing alarm contact calls from safe contact calls. The role of the ADS in encoding the names of objects (phonological long-term memory) is interpreted as evidence of gradual transition from modifying calls with intonations to complete vocal control. The role of the ADS in the integration of lip movements with phonemes and in speech repetition is interpreted as evidence that spoken words were learned by infants mimicking their parents' vocalizations, initially by imitating their lip movements. The role of the ADS in phonological working memory is interpreted as evidence that the words learned through mimicry remained active in the ADS even when not spoken. This resulted with individuals capable of rehearsing a list of vocalizations, which enabled the production of words with several syllables. Further developments in the ADS enabled the rehearsal of lists of words, which provided the infra-structure for communicating with sentences.\n\nSign language in the brain[edit]\nNeuroscientific research has provided a scientific understanding of how sign language is processed in the brain. There are over 135 discrete sign languages around the world- making use of different accents formed by separate areas of a country.[205]\nBy utilizing lesion analyses and neuroimaging, neuroscientists have discovered that whether it be spoken or sign language, human brains process language in general, in a similar manner regarding which area of the brain is being used.[205]Lesion analyses are used to examine the consequences of damage to specific brain regions involved in language while neuroimaging explore regions that are engaged in the processing of language.[205]\nPrevious hypotheses have been made that damage to Broca's area or Wernicke's area does not affect sign language being perceived; however, it is not the case. Studies have shown that damage to these areas are similar in results in spoken language where sign errors are present and/or repeated.[205]In both types of languages, they are affected by damage to the left hemisphere of the brain rather than the right -usually dealing with the arts.\nThere are obvious patterns for utilizing and processing language. Both speaking and signing activate Broca's area, while processing sign language employs Wernicke's area similar to that of spoken language.[205]\nThere have been other hypotheses about the lateralization of the two hemispheres. Specifically, the right hemisphere was thought to contribute to the overall communication of a language globally whereas the left hemisphere would be dominant in generating the language locally.[206] Through research in aphasias, RHD signers were found to have a problem maintaining the spatial portion of their signs, confusing similar signs at different locations necessary to communicate with another properly.[206] LHD signers, on the other hand, had similar results to those of hearing patients. Furthermore, other studies have emphasized that sign language is present bilaterally but will need to continue researching to reach a conclusion.[206]\n\nWriting in the brain[edit]\nThere is a comparatively small body of research on the neurology of reading and writing.[207] Most of the studies performed deal with reading rather than writing or spelling, and the majority of both kinds focus solely on the English language.[208] English orthography is less transparent than that of other languages using a Latin script.[207] Another difficulty is that some studies focus on spelling words of English and omit the few logographic characters found in the script.[207]\nIn terms of spelling, English words can be divided into three categories – regular, irregular, and \"novel words\" or \"nonwords.\" Regular words are those in which there is a regular, one-to-one correspondence between grapheme and phoneme in spelling. Irregular words are those in which no such correspondence exists. Nonwords are those that exhibit the expected orthography of regular words but do not carry meaning, such as nonce words and onomatopoeia.[207]\nAn issue in the cognitive and neurological study of reading and spelling in English is whether a single-route or dual-route model best describes how literate speakers are able to read and write all three categories of English words according to accepted standards of orthographic correctness. Single-route models posit that lexical memory is used to store all spellings of words for retrieval in a single process. Dual-route models posit that lexical memory is employed to process irregular and high-frequency regular words, while low-frequency regular words and nonwords are processed using a sub-lexical set of phonological rules.[207]\nThe single-route model for reading has found support in computer modelling studies, which suggest that readers identify words by their orthographic similarities to phonologically alike words.[207] However, cognitive and lesion studies lean towards the dual-route model. Cognitive spelling studies on children and adults suggest that spellers employ phonological rules in spelling regular words and nonwords, while lexical memory is accessed to spell irregular words and high-frequency words of all types.[207] Similarly, lesion studies indicate that lexical memory is used to store irregular words and certain regular words, while phonological rules are used to spell nonwords.[207]\nMore recently, neuroimaging studies using positron emission tomography and fMRI have suggested a balanced model in which the reading of all word types begins in the visual word form area, but subsequently branches off into different routes depending upon whether or not access to lexical memory or semantic information is needed (which would be expected with irregular words under a dual-route model).[207] A 2007 fMRI study found that subjects asked to produce regular words in a spelling task exhibited greater activation in the left posterior STG, an area used for phonological processing, while the spelling of irregular words produced greater activation of areas used for lexical memory and semantic processing, such as the left IFG and left SMG and both hemispheres of the MTG.[207] Spelling nonwords was found to access members of both pathways, such as the left STG and bilateral MTG and ITG.[207] Significantly, it was found that spelling induces activation in areas such as the left fusiform gyrus and left SMG that are also important in reading, suggesting that a similar pathway is used for both reading and writing.[207]\nFar less information exists on the cognition and neurology of non-alphabetic and non-English scripts. Every language has a morphological and a phonological component, either of which can be recorded by a writing system. Scripts recording words and morphemes are considered logographic, while those recording phonological segments, such as syllabaries and alphabets, are phonographic.[208] Most systems combine the two and have both logographic and phonographic characters.[208]\nIn terms of complexity, writing systems can be characterized as \"transparent\" or \"opaque\" and as \"shallow\" or \"deep\". A \"transparent\" system exhibits an obvious correspondence between grapheme and sound, while in an \"opaque\" system this relationship is less obvious. The terms \"shallow\" and \"deep\" refer to the extent that a system's orthography represents morphemes as opposed to phonological segments.[208] Systems that record larger morphosyntactic or phonological segments, such as logographic systems and syllabaries put greater demand on the memory of users.[208] It would thus be expected that an opaque or deep writing system would put greater demand on areas of the brain used for lexical memory than would a system with transparent or shallow orthography.\n\n\n\nSign language\nPhonology\nAuditory processing disorder\nBrodmann area\nComputational audiology\nCognitive science\nDevelopmental verbal dyspraxia\nFOXP2\nLanguage disorder\nNeurobiology\nNeurolinguistics\nNeuropsychology\nNeuroscience\nOrigin of language\nVisual word form area\n\n\n\n^ Seidenberg MS, Petitto LA (1987). \"Communication, symbolic communication, and language: Comment on Savage-Rumbaugh, McDonald, Sevcik, Hopkins, and Rupert (1986)\".

    "content": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\nNatural language processing (NLP) is the processing of natural language information by a computer. NLP is a subfield of computer science and is closely associated with artificial intelligence. NLP is also related to information retrieval, knowledge representation, computational linguistics, and linguistics more broadly.[1]\nMajor processing tasks in an NLP system include: speech recognition, text classification, natural language understanding, and natural language generation.\n\n\n\n\nNatural language processing has its roots in the 1950s.[2] Already in 1950, Alan Turing published an article titled \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\" which proposed what is now called the Turing test as a criterion of intelligence, though at the time that was not articulated as a problem separate from artificial intelligence. The proposed test includes a task that involves the automated interpretation and generation of natural language.\n\nSymbolic NLP (1950s – early 1990s)[edit]\nA document parsed into an abstract syntax tree\nThe premise of symbolic NLP is often illustrated using John Searle's Chinese room thought experiment: Given a collection of rules (e.g., a Chinese phrasebook, with questions and matching answers), the computer emulates natural language understanding (or other NLP tasks) by applying those rules to the data it confronts.\n\n1950s: The Georgetown experiment in 1954 involved fully automatic translation of more than sixty Russian sentences into English. The authors claimed that within three or five years, machine translation would be a solved problem.[3]  However, real progress was much slower, and after the ALPAC report in 1966, which found that ten years of research had failed to fulfill the expectations, funding for machine translation was dramatically reduced. Little further research in machine translation was conducted in America (though some research continued elsewhere, such as Japan and Europe[4]) until the late 1980s when the first statistical machine translation systems were developed.\n1960s: Some notably successful natural language processing systems developed in the 1960s were SHRDLU, a natural language system working in restricted \"blocks worlds\" with restricted vocabularies, and ELIZA, a simulation of a Rogerian psychotherapy, written by Joseph Weizenbaum between 1964 and 1966. Despite using minimal information about human thought or emotion, ELIZA was able to produce interactions that appeared human-like. When the \"patient\" exceeded the very small knowledge base, ELIZA might provide a generic response, for example, responding to \"My head hurts\" with \"Why do you say your head hurts?\". Ross Quillian's successful work on natural language was demonstrated with a vocabulary of only twenty words, because that was all that would fit in a computer  memory at the time.[5]\n1970s: During the 1970s, many programmers began to write \"conceptual ontologies\", which structured real-world information into computer-understandable data.  Examples are MARGIE (Schank, 1975), SAM (Cullingford, 1978), PAM (Wilensky, 1978), TaleSpin (Meehan, 1976), QUALM (Lehnert, 1977), Politics (Carbonell, 1979), and Plot Units (Lehnert 1981).  During this time, the first chatterbots were written (e.g., PARRY).\n1980s: The 1980s and early 1990s mark the heyday of symbolic methods in NLP. Focus areas of the time included research on rule-based parsing (e.g., the development of HPSG as a computational operationalization of generative grammar), morphology (e.g., two-level morphology[6]), semantics (e.g., Lesk algorithm), reference (e.g., within Centering Theory[7]) and other areas of natural language understanding (e.g., in the Rhetorical Structure Theory). Other lines of research were continued, e.g., the development of chatterbots with Racter and Jabberwacky. An important development (that eventually led to the statistical turn in the 1990s) was the rising importance of quantitative evaluation in this period.[8]\nStatistical NLP (1990s–present)[edit]\nUp until the 1980s, most natural language processing systems were based on complex sets of hand-written rules. Starting in the late 1980s, however, there was a revolution in natural language processing with the introduction of machine learning algorithms for language processing. This shift was influenced by increasing computational power (see Moore's law) and a decline in the dominance of Chomskyan linguistic theories... (e.g. transformational grammar), whose theoretical underpinnings discouraged the sort of corpus linguistics that underlies the machine-learning approach to language processing.[9] \n\n1990s: Many of the notable early successes in statistical methods in NLP occurred in the field of machine translation, due especially to work at IBM Research, such as IBM alignment models. These systems were able to take advantage of existing multilingual textual corpora that had been produced by the Parliament of Canada and the European Union as a result of laws calling for the translation of all governmental proceedings into all official languages of the corresponding systems of government.  However, most other systems depended on corpora specifically developed for the tasks implemented by these systems, which was (and often continues to be) a major limitation in the success of these systems. As a result, a great deal of research has gone into methods of more effectively learning from limited amounts of data.\n2000s: With the growth of the web, increasing amounts of raw (unannotated) language data have become available since the mid-1990s. Research has thus increasingly focused on unsupervised and semi-supervised learning algorithms. Such algorithms can learn from data that has not been hand-annotated with the desired answers or using a combination of annotated and non-annotated data. Generally, this task is much more difficult than supervised learning, and typically produces less accurate results for a given amount of input data. However, large quantities of non-annotated data are available (including, among other things, the entire content of the World Wide Web), which can often make up for the worse efficiency if the algorithm used has a low enough time complexity to be practical.\n2003: word n-gram model, at the time the best statistical algorithm, is outperformed by a multi-layer perceptron (with a single hidden layer and context length of several words, trained on up to 14 million words, by Bengio et al.)[10]\n2010: Tomáš Mikolov (then a PhD student at Brno University of Technology) with co-authors applied a simple recurrent neural network with a single hidden layer to language modeling,[11] and in the following years he went on to develop Word2vec. In the 2010s, representation learning and deep neural network-style (featuring many hidden layers) machine learning methods became widespread in natural language processing. This shift gained momentum due to results showing that such techniques[12][13] can achieve state-of-the-art results in many natural language tasks, e.g., in language modeling[14] and parsing.[15][16] This is increasingly important in medicine and healthcare, where NLP helps analyze notes and text in electronic health records that would otherwise be inaccessible for study when seeking to improve care[17] or protect patient privacy.[18]\nApproaches: Symbolic, statistical, neural networks[edit]\nSymbolic approach, i.e., the hand-coding of a set of rules for manipulating symbols, coupled with a dictionary lookup, was historically the first approach used both by AI in general and by NLP in particular:[19][20] such as by writing grammars or devising heuristic rules for stemming.\nMachine learning approaches, which include both statistical and neural networks, on the other hand, have many advantages over the symbolic approach: \n\nboth statistical and neural networks methods can focus more on the most common cases extracted from a corpus of texts, whereas the rule-based approach needs to provide rules for both rare cases and common ones equally.\nlanguage models, produced by either statistical or neural networks methods, are more robust to both unfamiliar (e.g. containing words or structures that have not been seen before) and erroneous input (e.g. with misspelled words or words accidentally omitted) in comparison to the rule-based systems, which are also more costly to produce.\nthe larger such a (probabilistic) language model is, the more accurate it becomes, in contrast to rule-based systems that can gain accuracy only by increasing the amount and complexity of the rules leading to intractability problems.\nRule-based systems are commonly used:\n\nwhen the amount of training data is insufficient to successfully apply machine learning methods, e.g., for the machine translation of low-resource languages such as provided by the Apertium system,\nfor preprocessing in NLP pipelines, e.g., tokenization, or\nfor post-processing and transforming the output of NLP pipelines, e.g., for knowledge extraction from syntactic parses.\nStatistical approach[edit]\nIn the late 1980s and mid-1990s, the statistical approach ended a period of AI winter, which was caused by the inefficiencies of the rule-based approaches.[21][22]\nThe earliest decision trees, producing systems of hard if–then rules, were still very similar to the old rule-based approaches.\nOnly the introduction of hidden Markov models, applied to part-of-speech tagging, announced the end of the old rule-based approach.\n\n\n\nA major drawback of statistical methods is that they require elaborate feature engineering. Since 2015,[23] neural network–based methods have increasingly replaced traditional statistical approaches, using semantic networks[24] and word embeddings to capture semantic properties of words.  \nIntermediate tasks (e.g., part-of-speech tagging and dependency parsing) are not needed anymore. \nNeural machine translation, based on then-newly invented sequence-to-sequence transformations, made obsolete the intermediate steps, such as word alignment, previously necessary for statistical machine translation.\n\n\nThe following is a list of some of the most commonly researched tasks in natural language processing. Some of these tasks have direct real-world applications, while others more commonly serve as subtasks that are used to aid in solving larger tasks.\nThough natural language processing tasks are closely intertwined, they can be subdivided into categories for convenience. A coarse division is given below.\n\nText and speech processing[edit]\nWord cloud of stop words in Hebrew\nOptical character recognition (OCR)\nGiven an image representing printed text, determine the corresponding text.\nSpeech recognition\nGiven a sound clip of a person or people speaking, determine the textual representation of the speech.  This is the opposite of text to speech and is one of the extremely difficult problems colloquially termed \"AI-complete\" (see above).  In natural speech there are hardly any pauses between successive words, and thus speech segmentation is a necessary subtask of speech recognition (see below). In most spoken languages, the sounds representing successive letters blend into each other in a process termed coarticulation, so the conversion of the analog signal to discrete characters can be a very difficult process. Also, given that words in the same language are spoken by people with different accents, the speech recognition software must be able to recognize the wide variety of input as being identical to each other in terms of its textual equivalent.\nSpeech segmentation\nGiven a sound clip of a person or people speaking, separate it into words.  A subtask of speech recognition and typically grouped with it.\nText-to-speech\nGiven a text, transform those units and produce a spoken representation. Text-to-speech can be used to aid the visually impaired.[25]\nWord segmentation (Tokenization)\nTokenization is a text-processing technique that divides text into individual words or word fragments. This technique results in two key components: a word index and tokenized text. The word index is a list that maps unique words to specific numerical identifiers, and the tokenized text replaces each word with its corresponding numerical token. These numerical tokens are then used in various deep learning methods.[26]\nFor a language like English, this is fairly trivial, since words are usually separated by spaces. However, some written languages like Chinese, Japanese and Thai do not mark word boundaries in such a fashion, and in those languages text segmentation is a significant task requiring knowledge of the vocabulary and morphology of words in the language. Sometimes this process is also used in cases like bag of words (BOW) creation in data mining.[27]\nMorphological analysis[edit]\nLemmatization of Basque words\nLemmatization\nThe task of removing inflectional endings only and to return the base dictionary form of a word which is also known as a lemma. Lemmatization is another technique for reducing words to their normalized form. But in this case, the transformation actually uses a dictionary to map words to their actual form.[28]\nMorphological segmentation\nSeparate words into individual morphemes and identify the class of the morphemes. The difficulty of this task depends greatly on the complexity of the morphology (i.e., the structure of words) of the language being considered. English has fairly simple morphology, especially inflectional morphology, and thus it is often possible to ignore this task entirely and simply model all possible forms of a word (e.g., \"open, opens, opened, opening\") as separate words. In languages such as Turkish or Meitei, a highly agglutinated Indian language, however, such an approach is not possible, as each dictionary entry has thousands of possible word forms.[29]\nPart-of-speech tagging\nGiven a sentence, determine the part of speech (POS) for each word. Many words, especially common ones, can serve as multiple parts of speech. For example, \"book\" can be a noun (\"the book on the table\") or verb (\"to book a flight\"); \"set\" can be a noun, verb or adjective; and \"out\" can be any of at least five different parts of speech.\nStemming\nThe process of reducing inflected (or sometimes derived) words to a base form (e.g., \"close\" will be the root for \"closed\", \"closing\", \"close\", \"closer\" etc.). Stemming yields similar results as lemmatization, but does so on grounds of rules, not a dictionary.\n\n\nGrammar induction[30]\nGenerate a formal grammar that describes a language's syntax.\nSentence breaking (also known as \"sentence boundary disambiguation\")\nGiven a chunk of text, find the sentence boundaries. Sentence boundaries are often marked by periods or other punctuation marks, but these same characters can serve other purposes (e.g., marking abbreviations).\nParsing\nDetermine the parse tree (grammatical analysis) of a given sentence. The grammar for natural languages is ambiguous and typical sentences have multiple possible analyses: perhaps surprisingly, for a typical sentence there may be thousands of potential parses (most of which will seem completely nonsensical to a human). There are two primary types of parsing: dependency parsing and constituency parsing. Dependency parsing focuses on the relationships between words in a sentence (marking things like primary objects and predicates), whereas constituency parsing focuses on building out the parse tree using a probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) (see also stochastic grammar).\nLexical semantics (of individual words in context)[edit]\nAn entity linking pipeline\nLexical semantics\nWhat is the computational meaning of individual words in context?\nDistributional semantics\nHow can we learn semantic representations from data?\nNamed entity recognition (NER)\nGiven a stream of text, determine which items in the text map to proper names, such as people or places, and what the type of each such name is (e.g. person, location, organization). Although capitalization can aid in recognizing named entities in languages such as English, this information cannot aid in determining the type of named entity, and in any case, is often inaccurate or insufficient.  For example, the first letter of a sentence is also capitalized, and named entities often span several words, only some of which are capitalized.  Furthermore, many other languages in non-Western scripts (e.g. Chinese or Arabic) do not have any capitalization at all, and even languages with capitalization may not consistently use it to distinguish names. For example, German capitalizes all nouns, regardless of whether they are names, and French and Spanish do not capitalize names that serve as adjectives. This task is also referred to as token classification.[31]\nSentiment analysis (see also Multimodal sentiment analysis)\nSentiment analysis involves identifying and classifying the emotional tone expressed in text. This technique involves analyzing text to determine whether the expressed sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. Models for sentiment classification typically utilize inputs such as word n-grams, Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) features, hand-generated features, or employ deep learning models designed to recognize both long-term and short-term dependencies in text sequences. The applications of sentiment analysis are diverse, extending to tasks such as categorizing customer reviews on various online platforms.[26]\nTerminology extraction\nThe goal of terminology extraction is to automatically extract relevant terms from a given corpus.\nWord-sense disambiguation (WSD)\nMany words have more than one meaning; we have to select the meaning which makes the most sense in context.  For this problem, we are typically given a list of words and associated word senses, e.g. from a dictionary or an online resource such as WordNet.\nEntity linking\nMany words—typically proper names—refer to named entities; here we have to select the entity (a famous individual, a location, a company, etc.) which is referred to in context.\nRelational semantics (semantics of individual sentences)[edit]\nRelationship extraction\nGiven a chunk of text, identify the relationships among named entities (e.g. who is married to whom).\nSemantic parsing\nGiven a piece of text (typically a sentence), produce a formal representation of its semantics, either as a graph (e.g., in AMR parsing) or in accordance with a logical formalism (e.g., in DRT parsing). This challenge typically includes aspects of several more elementary NLP tasks from semantics (e.g., semantic role labelling, word-sense disambiguation) and can be extended to include full-fledged discourse analysis (e.g., discourse analysis, coreference; see Natural language understanding below).\nSemantic role labelling (see also implicit semantic role labelling below)\nGiven a single sentence, identify and disambiguate semantic predicates (e.g., verbal frames), then identify and classify the frame elements (semantic roles).\nDiscourse (semantics beyond individual sentences)[edit]\nCoreference resolution\nGiven a sentence or larger chunk of text, determine which words (\"mentions\") refer to the same objects (\"entities\"). Anaphora resolution is a specific example of this task, and is specifically concerned with matching up pronouns with the nouns or names to which they refer. The more general task of coreference resolution also includes identifying so-called \"bridging relationships\" involving referring expressions. For example, in a sentence such as \"He entered John's house through the front door\", \"the front door\" is a referring expression and the bridging relationship to be identified is the fact that the door being referred to is the front door of John's house (rather than of some other structure that might also be referred to).\nDiscourse analysis\nThis rubric includes several related tasks.  One task is discourse parsing, i.e., identifying the discourse structure of a connected text, i.e. the nature of the discourse relationships between sentences (e.g. elaboration, explanation, contrast).  Another possible task is recognizing and classifying the speech acts in a chunk of text (e.g. yes–no question, content question, statement, assertion, etc.).\nImplicit semantic role labelling\nGiven a single sentence, identify and disambiguate semantic predicates (e.g., verbal frames) and their explicit semantic roles in the current sentence (see Semantic role labelling above). Then, identify semantic roles that are not explicitly realized in the current sentence, classify them into arguments that are explicitly realized elsewhere in the text and those that are not specified, and resolve the former against the local text. A closely related task is zero anaphora resolution, i.e., the extension of coreference resolution to pro-drop languages.\nRecognizing textual entailment\nGiven two text fragments, determine if one being true entails the other, entails the other's negation, or allows the other to be either true or false.[32]\nTopic segmentation and recognition\nGiven a chunk of text, separate it into segments each of which is devoted to a topic, and identify the topic of the segment.\nArgument mining\nThe goal of argument mining is the automatic extraction and identification of argumentative structures from natural language text with the aid of computer programs.[33] Such argumentative structures include the premise, conclusions, the argument scheme and the relationship between the main and subsidiary argument, or the main and counter-argument within discourse.[34][35]\nHigher-level NLP applications[edit]\nMachine translation in Firefox\nAutomatic summarization (text summarization)\nProduce a readable summary of a chunk of text.  Often used to provide summaries of the text of a known type, such as research papers, articles in the financial section of a newspaper.\nGrammatical error correction\nGrammatical error detection and correction involves a great band-width of problems on all levels of linguistic analysis (phonology/orthography, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics). Grammatical error correction is impactful since it affects hundreds of millions of people that use or acquire English as a second language. It has thus been subject to a number of shared tasks since 2011.[36][37][38] As far as orthography, morphology, syntax and certain aspects of semantics are concerned, and due to the development of powerful neural language models such as GPT-2, this can now (2019) be considered a largely solved problem and is being marketed in various commercial applications.\nLogic translation\nTranslate a text from a natural language into formal logic.\nMachine translation (MT)\nAutomatically translate text from one human language to another.  This is one of the most difficult problems, and is a member of a class of problems colloquially termed \"AI-complete\", i.e. requiring all of the different types of knowledge that humans possess (grammar, semantics, facts about the real world, etc.) to solve properly.\nNatural language understanding (NLU)\nConvert chunks of text into more formal representations such as first-order logic structures that are easier for computer programs to manipulate. Natural language understanding involves the identification of the intended semantic from the multiple possible semantics which can be derived from a natural language expression which usually takes the form of organized notations of natural language concepts. Introduction and creation of language metamodel and ontology are efficient however empirical solutions. An explicit formalization of natural language semantics without confusions with implicit assumptions such as closed-world assumption (CWA) vs. open-world assumption, or subjective Yes/No vs. objective True/False is expected for the construction of a basis of semantics formalization.[39]\nNatural language generation (NLG):\nConvert information from computer databases or semantic intents into readable human language.\nBook generation\nNot an NLP task proper but an extension of natural language generation and other NLP tasks is the creation of full-fledged books. The first machine-generated book was created by a rule-based system in 1984 (Racter, The policeman's beard is half-constructed).[40] The first published work by a neural network was published in 2018, 1 the Road, marketed as a novel, contains sixty million words. Both these systems are basically elaborate but non-sensical (semantics-free) language models. The first machine-generated science book was published in 2019 (Beta Writer, Lithium-Ion Batteries, Springer, Cham).[41] Unlike Racter and 1 the Road, this is grounded on factual knowledge and based on text summarization.\nDocument AI\nA Document AI platform sits on top of the NLP technology enabling users with no prior experience of artificial intelligence, machine learning or NLP to quickly train a computer to extract the specific data they need from different document types. NLP-powered Document AI enables non-technical teams to quickly access information hidden in documents, for example, lawyers, business analysts and accountants.[42]\nDialogue management\nComputer systems intended to converse with a human.\nQuestion answering\nGiven a human-language question, determine its answer. Typical questions have a specific right answer (such as \"What is the capital of Canada?\"), but sometimes open-ended questions are also considered (such as \"What is the meaning of life?\").\nText-to-image generation\nGiven a description of an image, generate an image that matches the description.[43]\nText-to-scene generation\nGiven a description of a scene, generate a 3D model of the scene.[44][45]\nText-to-video\nGiven a description of a video, generate a video that matches the description.[46][47]\nGeneral tendencies and (possible) future directions[edit]\nBased on long-standing trends in the field, it is possible to extrapolate future directions of NLP. As of 2020, three trends among the topics of the long-standing series of CoNLL Shared Tasks can be observed:[48]\n\nInterest on increasingly abstract, \"cognitive\" aspects of natural language (1999–2001: shallow parsing, 2002–03: named entity recognition, 2006–09/2017–18: dependency syntax, 2004–05/2008–09 semantic role labelling, 2011–12 coreference, 2015–16: discourse parsing, 2019: semantic parsing).\nIncreasing interest in multilinguality, and, potentially, multimodality (English since 1999; Spanish, Dutch since 2002; German since 2003; Bulgarian, Danish, Japanese, Portuguese, Slovenian, Swedish, Turkish since 2006; Basque, Catalan, Chinese, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Turkish since 2007; Czech since 2009; Arabic since 2012; 2017: 40+ languages; 2018: 60+/100+ languages)\nElimination of symbolic representations (rule-based over supervised towards weakly supervised methods, representation learning and end-to-end systems)\n\nMost higher-level NLP applications involve aspects that emulate intelligent behavior and apparent comprehension of natural language. More broadly speaking, the technical operationalization of increasingly advanced aspects of cognitive behavior represents one of the developmental trajectories of NLP (see trends among CoNLL shared tasks above).\nCognition refers to \"the mental action or process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought, experience, and the senses.\"[49] Cognitive science is the interdisciplinary, scientific study of the mind and its processes.[50] Cognitive linguistics is an interdisciplinary branch of linguistics, combining knowledge and research from both psychology and linguistics.[51] Especially during the age of symbolic NLP, the area of computational linguistics maintained strong ties with cognitive studies.\nAs an example, George Lakoff offers a methodology to build natural language processing (NLP) algorithms through the perspective of cognitive science, along with the findings of cognitive linguistics,[52] with two defining aspects:\n\nApply the theory of conceptual metaphor, explained by Lakoff as \"the understanding of one idea, in terms of another\" which provides an idea of the intent of the author.[53] For example, consider the English word big. When used in a comparison (\"That is a big tree\"), the author's intent is to imply that the tree is physically large relative to other trees or the authors experience.  When used metaphorically (\"Tomorrow is a big day\"), the author's intent to imply importance.  The intent behind other usages, like in \"She is a big person\", will remain somewhat ambiguous to a person and a cognitive NLP algorithm alike without additional information.\nAssign relative measures of meaning to a word, phrase, sentence or piece of text based on the information presented before and after the piece of text being analyzed, e.g., by means of a probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG). The mathematical equation for such algorithms is presented in US Patent 9269353:[54]\n\nWhere\nRMM is the relative measure of meaning\ntoken is any block of text, sentence, phrase or word\nN is the number of tokens being analyzed\nPMM is the probable measure of meaning based on a corpora\nd is the non zero location of the token along the sequence of N tokens\nPF is the probability function specific to a language\nTies with cognitive linguistics are part of the historical heritage of NLP, but they have been less frequently addressed since the statistical turn during the 1990s. Nevertheless, approaches to develop cognitive models towards technically operationalizable frameworks have been pursued in the context of various frameworks, e.g., of cognitive grammar,[55] functional grammar,[56] construction grammar,[57] computational psycholinguistics and cognitive neuroscience (e.g., ACT-R), however, with limited uptake in mainstream NLP (as measured by presence on major conferences[58] of the ACL). More recently, ideas of cognitive NLP have been revived as an approach to achieve explainability, e.g., under the notion of \"cognitive AI\".[59] Likewise, ideas of cognitive NLP are inherent to neural models multimodal NLP (although rarely made explicit)[60] and developments in artificial intelligence, specifically tools and technologies using large language model approaches[61] and new directions in artificial general intelligence based on the free energy principle[62] by British neuroscientist and theoretician at University College London Karl J. Friston.\n\n\n\n1 the Road\nArtificial intelligence detection software\nAutomated essay scoring\nBiomedical text mining\nCompound term processing\nComputational linguistics\nComputer-assisted reviewing\nControlled natural language\nDeep learning\nDeep linguistic processing\nDistributional semantics\nForeign language reading aid\nForeign language writing aid\nInformation extraction\nInformation retrieval\nLanguage and Communication Technologies\nLanguage model\nLanguage technology\nLatent semantic indexing\nMulti-agent system\nNative-language identification\nNatural-language programming\nNatural-language understanding\nNatural-language search\nOutline of natural language processing\nQuery expansion\nQuery understanding\nReification (linguistics)\nSpeech processing\nSpoken dialogue systems\nText-proofing\nText simplification\nTransformer (machine learning model)\nTruecasing\nQuestion answering\nWord2vec\n\n\n\n^  \nEisenstein, Jacob (October 1, 2019).

In addition, theoretical underpinnings of Chomskyan linguistics such as the so-called \"poverty of the stimulus\" argument entail that general learning algorithms, as are typically used in machine learning, cannot be successful in language processing.  As a result, the Chomskyan paradigm discouraged the application of such models to language processing.\n\n^ Bengio, Yoshua; Ducharme, Réjean; Vincent, Pascal; Janvin, Christian (March 1, 2003). \"A neural probabilistic language model\".

    "content": "In computer science, computer engineering, and telecommunications, a network is a group of communicating computers and peripherals known as hosts, which communicate data to other hosts via communication protocols, as facilitated by networking hardware.\nWithin a computer network, hosts are identified by network addresses, which allow networking hardware to locate and identify hosts. Hosts may also have hostnames, memorable labels for the host nodes, which can be mapped to a network address using a hosts file or a name server such as Domain Name Service. The physical medium that supports information exchange includes wired media like copper cables, optical fibers, and wireless radio-frequency media. The arrangement of hosts and hardware within a network architecture is known as the network topology.[1][2]\nThe first computer network was created in 1940 when George Stibitz connected a terminal at Dartmouth to his Complex Number Calculator at Bell Labs in New York. Today, almost all computers are connected to a computer network, such as the global Internet or embedded networks such as those found in many modern electronic devices. Many applications have only limited functionality unless they are connected to a network. Networks support applications and services, such as access to the World Wide Web, digital video and audio, application and storage servers, printers, and email and instant messaging applications.\n\n\n\nEarly origins (1940 – 1960s)[edit]\nIn 1940, George Stibitz of Bell Labs connected a teletype at Dartmouth to a Bell Labs computer running his Complex Number Calculator to demonstrate the use of computers at long distance.[3][4] This was the first real-time, remote use of a computing machine.[3]\nIn the late 1950s, a network of computers was built for the U.S. military Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) radar system[5][6][7] using the Bell 101 modem. It was the first commercial modem for computers, released by AT&T Corporation in 1958. The modem allowed digital data to be transmitted over regular unconditioned telephone lines at a speed of 110 bits per second (bit/s). In 1959, Christopher Strachey filed a patent application for time-sharing in the United Kingdom and John McCarthy initiated the first project to implement time-sharing of user programs at MIT.[8][9][10][11] Strachey passed the concept on to J. C. R. Licklider at the inaugural UNESCO Information Processing Conference in Paris that year.[12] McCarthy was instrumental in the creation of three of the earliest time-sharing systems (the Compatible Time-Sharing System in 1961, the BBN Time-Sharing System in 1962, and the Dartmouth Time-Sharing System in 1963).\nIn 1959, Anatoly Kitov proposed to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union a detailed plan for the re-organization of the control of the Soviet armed forces and of the Soviet economy on the basis of a network of computing centers.[13] Kitov's proposal was rejected, as later was the 1962 OGAS economy management network project.[14] \nDuring the 1960s,[15][16] Paul Baran and Donald Davies independently invented the concept of packet switching for data communication between computers over a network.[17][18][19][20] Baran's work addressed adaptive routing of message blocks across a distributed network, but did not include routers with software switches, nor the idea that users, rather than the network itself, would provide the reliability.[21][22][23][24] Davies' hierarchical network design included high-speed routers, communication protocols and the essence of the end-to-end principle.[25][26][27][28] The NPL network, a local area network at the National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom), pioneered the implementation of the concept in 1968-69 using 768 kbit/s links.[29][27][30] Both Baran's and Davies' inventions were seminal contributions that influenced the development of computer networks.[31][32][33][34]\n\nARPANET (1969 – 1974)[edit]\nIn 1962 and 1963, J. C. R. Licklider sent a series of memos to office colleagues discussing the concept of the \"Intergalactic Computer Network\", a computer network intended to allow general communications among computer users. This ultimately became the basis for the ARPANET, which began in 1969.[35] That year, the first four nodes of the ARPANET were connected using 50 kbit/s circuits between the University of California at Los Angeles, the Stanford Research Institute, the University of California, Santa Barbara, and the University of Utah.[35][36] Designed principally by Bob Kahn, the network's routing, flow control, software design and network control were developed by the IMP team working for Bolt Beranek & Newman.[37][38][39] In the early 1970s, Leonard Kleinrock carried out mathematical work to model the performance of packet-switched networks, which underpinned the development of the ARPANET.[40][41] His theoretical work on hierarchical routing in the late 1970s with student Farouk Kamoun remains critical to the operation of the Internet today.[42][43]\nIn 1973, Peter Kirstein put internetworking into practice at University College London (UCL), connecting the ARPANET to British academic networks, the first international heterogeneous computer network.[44][45] That same year, Robert Metcalfe wrote a formal memo at Xerox PARC describing Ethernet,[46] a local area networking system he created with David Boggs.[47] It was inspired by the packet radio ALOHAnet, started by Norman Abramson and Franklin Kuo at the University of Hawaii in the late 1960s.[48][49] Metcalfe and Boggs, with John Shoch and Edward Taft, also developed the PARC Universal Packet for internetworking.[50] That year, the French CYCLADES network, directed by Louis Pouzin was the first to make the hosts responsible for the reliable delivery of data, rather than this being a centralized service of the network itself.[51] \n\nThe internet (1974 – present)[edit]\nIn 1974, Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn published their seminal 1974 paper on internetworking, A Protocol for Packet Network Intercommunication.[52] Later that year, Cerf, Yogen Dalal, and Carl Sunshine wrote the first Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) specification, RFC 675, coining the term Internet as a shorthand for internetworking.[53] In July 1976, Metcalfe and Boggs published their paper \"Ethernet: Distributed Packet Switching for Local Computer Networks\"[54] and in December 1977, together with Butler Lampson and Charles P. Thacker, they received U.S. patent 4063220A for their invention.[55][56]\nIn 1976, John Murphy of Datapoint Corporation created ARCNET, a token-passing network first used to share storage devices. In 1979, Robert Metcalfe pursued making Ethernet an open standard.[57] In 1980, Ethernet was upgraded from the original 2.94 Mbit/s protocol to the 10 Mbit/s protocol, which was developed by Ron Crane, Bob Garner, Roy Ogus,[58] Hal Murray, Dave Redell and Yogen Dalal.[59] In 1986, the National Science Foundation (NSF) launched the National Science Foundation Network (NSFNET) as a general-purpose research network connecting various NSF-funded sites to each other and to regional research and education networks.[35]\nIn 1995, the transmission speed capacity for Ethernet increased from 10 Mbit/s to 100 Mbit/s. By 1998, Ethernet supported transmission speeds of 1 Gbit/s. Subsequently, higher speeds of up to 800 Gbit/s were added (as of 2025). The scaling of Ethernet has been a contributing factor to its continued use.[57] In the 1980s and 1990s, as embedded systems were becoming increasingly important in factories, cars, and airplanes, network protocols were developed to allow the embedded computers to communicate. In the late 1990s and 2000s, ubiquitous computing and an Internet of Things became popular.[60][61]\n\n\nIn 1960, the commercial airline reservation system semi-automatic business research environment (SABRE) went online with two connected mainframes. In 1965, Western Electric introduced the first widely used telephone switch that implemented computer control in the switching fabric. In 1972, commercial services were first deployed on experimental public data networks in Europe.[62][63] Public data networks in Europe, North America and Japan began using X.25 in the late 1970s and interconnected with X.75.[18] This underlying infrastructure was used for expanding TCP/IP networks in the 1980s.[64] In 1977, the first long-distance fiber network was deployed by GTE in Long Beach, California.\n\n\n\n\nThe transmission media used to link devices to form a computer network include electrical cable, optical fiber, and free space. In the OSI model, the software to handle the media is defined at layers 1 and 2 — the physical layer and the data link layer. Common examples of networking technologies include:\n\nEthernet is a widely adopted family of networking technologies that use copper and fiber media in local area networks (LAN). The media and protocol standards that enable communication between networked devices over Ethernet are defined by IEEE 802.3.\nWireless LAN standards, which use radio waves. Some standards use infrared signals as a transmission medium.\nPower line communication uses a building's power cabling to transmit data.\n\nFiber-optic cables are used to transmit light from one computer/network node to another.\nThe following classes of wired technologies are used in computer networking.\n\nCoaxial cable is widely used for cable television systems, office buildings, and other work-sites for local area networks. Transmission speed ranges from 200 million bits per second to more than 500 million bits per second.[citation needed]\nITU-T G.hn technology uses existing home wiring (coaxial cable, phone lines and power lines) to create a high-speed local area network.\nTwisted pair cabling is used for wired Ethernet and other standards. It typically consists of 4 pairs of copper cabling that can be utilized for both voice and data transmission. The use of two wires twisted together helps to reduce crosstalk and electromagnetic induction. The transmission speed ranges from 2 Mbit/s to 10 Gbit/s. Twisted pair cabling comes in two forms: unshielded twisted pair (UTP) and shielded twisted-pair (STP). Each form comes in several category ratings, designed for use in various scenarios.\n2007 map showing submarine optical fiber telecommunication cables around the world\nAn optical fiber is a glass fiber that carries pulses of light that represent data via lasers and optical amplifiers. Some advantages of optical fibers over metal wires are very low transmission loss and immunity to electrical interference. Using dense wave division multiplexing, optical fibers can simultaneously carry multiple streams of data on different wavelengths of light, which greatly increases the rate that data can be sent to up to trillions of bits per second. Optic fibers can be used for long runs of cable carrying very high data rates, and are used for undersea communications cables to interconnect continents. There are two basic types of fiber optics, single-mode optical fiber (SMF) and multi-mode optical fiber (MMF).[65]\n\nComputers are very often connected to networks using wireless links.\n\nNetwork connections can be established wirelessly using radio or other electromagnetic means of communication.\n\n Terrestrial microwave – Terrestrial microwave communication uses Earth-based transmitters and receivers resembling satellite dishes. Terrestrial microwaves are in the low gigahertz range, which limits all communications to line-of-sight. Relay stations are spaced approximately 40 miles (64 km) apart.\nCommunications satellites – Satellites also communicate via microwave. The satellites are stationed in space, typically in geosynchronous orbit 35,400 km (22,000 mi) above the equator. These Earth-orbiting systems are capable of receiving and relaying voice, data, and TV signals.\nCellular networks use several radio communications technologies. The systems divide the region covered into multiple geographic areas. Each area is served by a low-power transceiver.\nRadio and spread spectrum technologies – Wireless LANs use a high-frequency radio technology similar to digital cellular. Wireless LANs use spread spectrum technology to enable communication between multiple devices in a limited area. IEEE 802.11 defines a common flavor of open-standards wireless radio-wave technology known as Wi-Fi.\nFree-space optical communication uses visible or invisible light for communications. In most cases, line-of-sight propagation is used, which limits the physical positioning of communicating devices.\nExtending the Internet to interplanetary dimensions via radio waves and optical means, the Interplanetary Internet.[66]\nIP over Avian Carriers was a humorous April fool's Request for Comments, issued as RFC 1149. It was implemented in real life in 2001.[67]\nThe last two cases have a large round-trip delay time, which gives slow two-way communication but does not prevent sending large amounts of information (they can have high throughput).\n\n\n\nApart from any physical transmission media, networks are built from additional basic system building blocks, such as network interface controllers, repeaters, hubs, bridges, switches, routers, modems, and firewalls. Any particular piece of equipment will frequently contain multiple building blocks and so may perform multiple functions.\n\n\n\nAn ATM network interface in the form of an accessory card. Many network interfaces are built-in.\nA network interface controller (NIC) is computer hardware that connects the computer to the network media and has the ability to process low-level network information. For example, the NIC may have a connector for plugging in a cable, or an aerial for wireless transmission and reception, and the associated circuitry.\nIn Ethernet networks, each NIC has a unique Media Access Control (MAC) address—usually stored in the controller's permanent memory. To avoid address conflicts between network devices, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) maintains and administers MAC address uniqueness. The size of an Ethernet MAC address is six octets. The three most significant octets are reserved to identify NIC manufacturers. These manufacturers, using only their assigned prefixes, uniquely assign the three least-significant octets of every Ethernet interface they produce.\n\n\n\nA repeater is an electronic device that receives a network signal, cleans it of unnecessary noise and regenerates it. The signal is retransmitted at a higher power level, or to the other side of obstruction so that the signal can cover longer distances without degradation. In most twisted-pair Ethernet configurations, repeaters are required for cable that runs longer than 100 meters. With fiber optics, repeaters can be tens or even hundreds of kilometers apart.\nRepeaters work on the physical layer of the OSI model but still require a small amount of time to regenerate the signal. This can cause a propagation delay that affects network performance and may affect proper function. As a result, many network architectures limit the number of repeaters used in a network, e.g., the Ethernet 5-4-3 rule.\nAn Ethernet repeater with multiple ports is known as an Ethernet hub. In addition to reconditioning and distributing network signals, a repeater hub assists with collision detection and fault isolation for the network. Hubs and repeaters in LANs have been largely obsoleted by modern network switches.\n\nBridges and switches[edit]\n\nNetwork bridges and network switches are distinct from a hub in that they only forward frames to the ports involved in the communication whereas a hub forwards to all ports. Bridges only have two ports but a switch can be thought of as a multi-port bridge. Switches normally have numerous ports, facilitating a star topology for devices, and for cascading additional switches.\nBridges and switches operate at the data link layer (layer 2) of the OSI model and bridge traffic between two or more network segments to form a single local network. Both are devices that forward frames of data between ports based on the destination MAC address in each frame.[68]\nThey learn the association of physical ports to MAC addresses by examining the source addresses of received frames and only forward the frame when necessary. If an unknown destination MAC is targeted, the device broadcasts the request to all ports except the source, and discovers the location from the reply.\nBridges and switches divide the network's collision domain but maintain a single broadcast domain. Network segmentation through bridging and switching helps break down a large, congested network into an aggregation of smaller, more efficient networks.\n\n\n\nA typical home or small office router showing the ADSL telephone line and Ethernet network cable connections\nA router is an internetworking device that forwards packets between networks by processing the addressing or routing information included in the packet. The routing information is often processed in conjunction with the routing table. A router uses its routing table to determine where to forward packets and does not require broadcasting packets which is inefficient for very big networks.\n\n\n\nModems (modulator-demodulator) are used to connect network nodes via wire not originally designed for digital network traffic, or for wireless. To do this one or more carrier signals are modulated by the digital signal to produce an analog signal that can be tailored to give the required properties for transmission. Early modems modulated audio signals sent over a standard voice telephone line. Modems are still commonly used for telephone lines, using a digital subscriber line technology and cable television systems using DOCSIS technology.\n\n\n\nThis is an image of a firewall separating a private network from a public network\nA firewall is a network device or software for controlling network security and access rules. Firewalls are inserted in connections between secure internal networks and potentially insecure external networks such as the Internet. Firewalls are typically configured to reject access requests from unrecognized sources while allowing actions from recognized ones. The vital role firewalls play in network security grows in parallel with the constant increase in cyber attacks.\n\n\n\nThe TCP/IP model and its relation to common protocols used at different layers of the model\nMessage flows between two devices (A-B) at the four layers of the TCP/IP model in the presence of a router (R). Red flows are effective communication paths, black paths are across the actual network links.\nA communication protocol is a set of rules for exchanging information over a network. Communication protocols have various characteristics, such as being connection-oriented or connectionless, or using circuit switching or packet switching.\nIn a protocol stack, often constructed per the OSI model, communications functions are divided into protocol layers, where each layer leverages the services of the layer below it until the lowest layer controls the hardware that sends information across the media. The use of protocol layering is ubiquitous across the field of computer networking. An important example of a protocol stack is HTTP, the World Wide Web protocol. HTTP runs over TCP over IP, the Internet protocols, which in turn run over IEEE 802.11, the Wi-Fi protocol. This stack is used between a wireless router and a personal computer when accessing the web.\n\n\nNetwork Packet\nMost modern computer networks use protocols based on packet-mode transmission. A network packet is a formatted unit of data carried by a packet-switched network.\nPackets consist of two types of data: control information and user data (payload). The control information provides data the network needs to deliver the user data, for example, source and destination network addresses, error detection codes, and sequencing information. Typically, control information is found in packet headers and trailers, with payload data in between.\nWith packets, the bandwidth of the transmission medium can be better shared among users than if the network were circuit switched. When one user is not sending packets, the link can be filled with packets from other users, and so the cost can be shared, with relatively little interference, provided the link is not overused. Often the route a packet needs to take through a network is not immediately available. In that case, the packet is queued and waits until a link is free.\nThe physical link technologies of packet networks typically limit the size of packets to a certain maximum transmission unit (MTU). A longer message may be fragmented before it is transferred and once the packets arrive, they are reassembled to construct the original message.\n\n\nInternet protocol suite[edit]\nThe Internet protocol suite, also called TCP/IP, is the foundation of all modern networking. It offers connection-less and connection-oriented services over an inherently unreliable network traversed by datagram transmission using Internet protocol (IP). At its core, the protocol suite defines the addressing, identification, and routing specifications for Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4) and for IPv6, the next generation of the protocol with a much enlarged addressing capability. The Internet protocol suite is the defining set of protocols for the Internet.[69]\n\n\nIEEE 802 is a family of IEEE standards dealing with local area networks and metropolitan area networks. The complete IEEE 802 protocol suite provides a diverse set of networking capabilities. The protocols have a flat addressing scheme. They operate mostly at layers 1 and 2 of the OSI model.\nFor example, MAC bridging (IEEE 802.1D) deals with the routing of Ethernet packets using a Spanning Tree Protocol. IEEE 802.1Q describes VLANs, and IEEE 802.1X defines a port-based network access control protocol, which forms the basis for the authentication mechanisms used in VLANs[70] (but it is also found in WLANs[71]) – it is what the home user sees when the user has to enter a \"wireless access key\".\n\n\nEthernet is a family of technologies used in wired LANs. It is described by a set of standards together called IEEE 802.3 published by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.\n\n\nWireless LAN based on the IEEE 802.11 standards, also widely known as WLAN or WiFi, is probably the most well-known member of the IEEE 802 protocol family for home users today. IEEE 802.11 shares many properties with wired Ethernet.\n\n\nSynchronous optical networking (SONET) and Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) are standardized multiplexing protocols that transfer multiple digital bit streams over optical fiber using lasers. They were originally designed to transport circuit mode communications from a variety of different sources, primarily to support circuit-switched digital telephony. However, due to its protocol neutrality and transport-oriented features, SONET/SDH also was the obvious choice for transporting Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) frames.\n\nAsynchronous Transfer Mode[edit]\nAsynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) is a switching technique for telecommunication networks. It uses asynchronous time-division multiplexing and encodes data into small, fixed-sized cells. This differs from other protocols such as the Internet protocol suite or Ethernet that use variable-sized packets or frames. ATM has similarities with both circuit and packet switched networking. This makes it a good choice for a network that must handle both traditional high-throughput data traffic, and real-time, low-latency content such as voice and video. ATM uses a connection-oriented model in which a virtual circuit must be established between two endpoints before the actual data exchange begins.\nATM still plays a role in the last mile, which is the connection between an Internet service provider and the home user.[72][needs update]\n\n\nThere are a number of different digital cellular standards, including: Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), cdmaOne, CDMA2000, Evolution-Data Optimized (EV-DO), Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE), Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications (DECT), Digital AMPS (IS-136/TDMA), and Integrated Digital Enhanced Network (iDEN).[73]\n\n\nRouting calculates good paths through a network for information to take. For example, from node 1 to node 6 the best routes are likely to be 1-8-7-6, 1-8-10-6 or 1-9-10-6, as these are the shortest routes.\nRouting is the process of selecting network paths to carry network traffic. Routing is performed for many kinds of networks, including circuit switching networks and packet switched networks.\nIn packet-switched networks, routing protocols direct packet forwarding through intermediate nodes. Intermediate nodes are typically network hardware devices such as routers, bridges, gateways, firewalls, or switches. General-purpose computers can also forward packets and perform routing, though because they lack specialized hardware, may offer limited performance. The routing process directs forwarding on the basis of routing tables, which maintain a record of the routes to various network destinations. Most routing algorithms use only one network path at a time. Multipath routing techniques enable the use of multiple alternative paths.\nRouting can be contrasted with bridging in its assumption that network addresses are structured and that similar addresses imply proximity within the network. Structured addresses allow a single routing table entry to represent the route to a group of devices. In large networks, the structured addressing used by routers outperforms unstructured addressing used by bridging. Structured IP addresses are used on the Internet. Unstructured MAC addresses are used for bridging on Ethernet and similar local area networks.\n\n\nCommon network topologies\n\nThe physical or geographic locations of network nodes and links generally have relatively little effect on a network, but the topology of interconnections of a network can significantly affect its throughput and reliability. With many technologies, such as bus or star networks, a single failure can cause the network to fail entirely. In general, the more interconnections there are, the more robust the network is; but the more expensive it is to install. Therefore, most network diagrams are arranged by their network topology which is the map of logical interconnections of network hosts.\nCommon topologies are:\n\nBus network: all nodes are connected to a common medium along this medium. This was the layout used in the original Ethernet, called 10BASE5 and 10BASE2. This is still a common topology on the data link layer, although modern physical layer variants use point-to-point links instead, forming a star or a tree.\nStar network: all nodes are connected to a special central node. This is the typical layout found in a small switched Ethernet LAN, where each client connects to a central network switch, and logically in a wireless LAN, where each wireless client associates with the central wireless access point.\nRing network: each node is connected to its left and right neighbor node, such that all nodes are connected and that each node can reach each other node by traversing nodes left- or rightwards. Token ring networks, and the Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI), made use of such a topology.\nMesh network: each node is connected to an arbitrary number of neighbors in such a way that there is at least one traversal from any node to any other.\nFully connected network: each node is connected to every other node in the network.\nTree network: nodes are arranged hierarchically. This is the natural topology for a larger Ethernet network with multiple switches and without redundant meshing.\nThe physical layout of the nodes in a network may not necessarily reflect the network topology. As an example, with FDDI, the network topology is a ring, but the physical topology is often a star, because all neighboring connections can be routed via a central physical location. Physical layout is not completely irrelevant, however, as common ducting and equipment locations can represent single points of failure due to issues like fires, power failures and flooding.\n\n\n\nA sample overlay network\nAn overlay network is a virtual network that is built on top of another network. Nodes in the overlay network are connected by virtual or logical links. Each link corresponds to a path, perhaps through many physical links, in the underlying network. The topology of the overlay network may (and often does) differ from that of the underlying one. For example, many peer-to-peer networks are overlay networks. They are organized as nodes of a virtual system of links that run on top of the Internet.[74]\nOverlay networks have been used since the early days of networking, back when computers were connected via telephone lines using modems, even before data networks were developed.\nThe most striking example of an overlay network is the Internet itself. The Internet itself was initially built as an overlay on the telephone network.[74] Even today, each Internet node can communicate with virtually any other through an underlying mesh of sub-networks of wildly different topologies and technologies. Address resolution and routing are the means that allow mapping of a fully connected IP overlay network to its underlying network.\nAnother example of an overlay network is a distributed hash table, which maps keys to nodes in the network. In this case, the underlying network is an IP network, and the overlay network is a table (actually a map) indexed by keys.\nOverlay networks have also been proposed as a way to improve Internet routing, such as through quality of service guarantees achieve higher-quality streaming media. Previous proposals such as IntServ, DiffServ, and IP multicast have not seen wide acceptance largely because they require modification of all routers in the network.[citation needed] On the other hand, an overlay network can be incrementally deployed on end-hosts running the overlay protocol software, without cooperation from Internet service providers. The overlay network has no control over how packets are routed in the underlying network between two overlay nodes, but it can control, for example, the sequence of overlay nodes that a message traverses before it reaches its destination[citation needed].\nFor example, Akamai Technologies manages an overlay network that provides reliable, efficient content delivery (a kind of multicast). Academic research includes end system multicast,[75] resilient routing and quality of service studies, among others.\n\n\n\nNetworks may be characterized by many properties or features, such as physical capacity, organizational purpose, user authorization, access rights, and others. Another distinct classification method is that of the physical extent or geographic scale.\n\n\nA nanoscale network has key components implemented at the nanoscale, including message carriers, and leverages physical principles that differ from macroscale communication mechanisms. Nanoscale communication extends communication to very small sensors and actuators such as those found in biological systems and also tends to operate in environments that would be too harsh for other communication techniques.[76]\n\nPersonal area network[edit]\nA personal area network (PAN) is a computer network used for communication among computers and different information technological devices close to one person. Some examples of devices that are used in a PAN are personal computers, printers, fax machines, telephones, PDAs, scanners, and video game consoles. A PAN may include wired and wireless devices. The reach of a PAN typically extends to 10 meters.[77] A wired PAN is usually constructed with USB and FireWire connections while technologies such as Bluetooth and infrared communication typically form a wireless PAN.\n\n\nA local area network (LAN) is a network that connects computers and devices in a limited geographical area such as a home, school, office building, or closely positioned group of buildings. Wired LANs are most commonly based on Ethernet technology. Other networking technologies such as ITU-T G.hn also provide a way to create a wired LAN using existing wiring, such as coaxial cables, telephone lines, and power lines.[78]\nA LAN can be connected to a wide area network (WAN) using a router. The defining characteristics of a LAN, in contrast to a WAN, include higher data transfer rates, limited geographic range, and lack of reliance on leased lines to provide connectivity.[citation needed] Current Ethernet or other IEEE 802.3 LAN technologies operate at data transfer rates up to and in excess of 100 Gbit/s,[79] standardized by IEEE in 2010.\n\nA home area network (HAN) is a residential LAN used for communication between digital devices typically deployed in the home, usually a small number of personal computers and accessories, such as printers and mobile computing devices. An important function is the sharing of Internet access, often a broadband service through a cable Internet access or digital subscriber line (DSL) provider.\nA storage area network (SAN) is a dedicated network that provides access to consolidated, block-level data storage. SANs are primarily used to make storage devices, such as disk arrays, tape libraries, and optical jukeboxes, accessible to servers so that the storage appears as locally attached devices to the operating system. A SAN typically has its own network of storage devices that are generally not accessible through the local area network by other devices. The cost and complexity of SANs dropped in the early 2000s to levels allowing wider adoption across both enterprise and small to medium-sized business environments.[citation needed]\nCampus area network[edit]\nA campus area network (CAN) is made up of an interconnection of LANs within a limited geographical area. The networking equipment (switches, routers) and transmission media (optical fiber, Cat5 cabling, etc.) are almost entirely owned by the campus tenant or owner (an enterprise, university, government, etc.). For example, a university campus network is likely to link a variety of campus buildings to connect academic colleges or departments, the library, and student residence halls.\n\n\nA backbone network is part of a computer network infrastructure that provides a path for the exchange of information between different LANs or subnetworks. A backbone can tie together diverse networks within the same building, across different buildings, or over a wide area. When designing a network backbone, network performance and network congestion are critical factors to take into account. Normally, the backbone network's capacity is greater than that of the individual networks connected to it.\nFor example, a large company might implement a backbone network to connect departments that are located around the world. The equipment that ties together the departmental networks constitutes the network backbone. Another example of a backbone network is the Internet backbone, which is a massive, global system of fiber-optic cable and optical networking that carry the bulk of data between wide area networks (WANs), metro, regional, national and transoceanic networks.\n\nAn enterprise private network or intranet is a network that a single organization builds to interconnect its office locations (e.g., production sites, head offices, remote offices, shops) so they can share computer resources.\nMetropolitan area network[edit]\nA metropolitan area network (MAN) is a large computer network that interconnects users with computer resources in a geographic region of the size of a metropolitan area.\n\n\nA wide area network (WAN) is a computer network that covers a large geographic area such as a city, country, or spans even intercontinental distances. A WAN uses a communications channel that combines many types of media such as telephone lines, cables, and airwaves. A WAN often makes use of transmission facilities provided by common carriers, such as telephone companies. WAN technologies generally function at the lower three layers of the OSI model: the physical layer, the data link layer, and the network layer.\n\nGlobal area network[edit]\nA global area network (GAN) is a network used for supporting mobile users across an arbitrary number of wireless LANs, satellite coverage areas, etc. The key challenge in mobile communications is handing off communications from one local coverage area to the next. In IEEE Project 802, this involves a succession of terrestrial wireless LANs.[80]\n\n\nAn intranet is a community of interest under private administration usually by an enterprise, and is only accessible by authorized users (e.g. employees).[81] Intranets do not have to be connected to the Internet, but generally have a limited connection. An extranet is an extension of an intranet that allows secure communications to users outside of the intranet (e.g. business partners, customers).[81]\nNetworks are typically managed by the organizations that own them. Private enterprise networks may use a combination of intranets and extranets. They may also provide network access to the Internet, which has no single owner and permits virtually unlimited global connectivity. \n\n\nAn intranet is a set of networks that are under the control of a single administrative entity. An intranet typically uses the Internet Protocol and IP-based tools such as web browsers and file transfer applications. The administrative entity limits the use of the intranet to its authorized users. Most commonly, an intranet is the internal LAN of an organization. A large intranet typically has at least one web server to provide users with organizational information. \n\n\nAn extranet is a network that is under the administrative control of a single organization but supports a limited connection to a specific external network. For example, an organization may provide access to some aspects of its intranet to share data with its business partners or customers. These other entities are not necessarily trusted from a security standpoint. The network connection to an extranet is often, but not always, implemented via WAN technology.\n\n\nPartial map of the Internet based on 2005 data.[82] Each line is drawn between two nodes, representing two IP addresses. The length of the lines indicates the delay between those two nodes.\nAn internetwork is the connection of multiple different types of computer networks to form a single computer network using higher-layer network protocols and connecting them together using routers.\nThe Internet is the largest example of internetwork. It is a global system of interconnected governmental, academic, corporate, public, and private computer networks. It is based on the networking technologies of the Internet protocol suite. It is the successor of the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) developed by DARPA of the United States Department of Defense. The Internet utilizes copper communications and an optical networking backbone to enable the World Wide Web (WWW), the Internet of things, video transfer, and a broad range of information services.\nParticipants on the Internet use a diverse array of methods of several hundred documented, and often standardized, protocols compatible with the Internet protocol suite and the IP addressing system administered by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority and address registries. Service providers and large enterprises exchange information about the reachability of their address spaces through the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), forming a redundant worldwide mesh of transmission paths.\n\n\nA darknet is an overlay network, typically running on the Internet, that is only accessible through specialized software. It is an anonymizing network where connections are made only between trusted peers — sometimes called friends (F2F)[83] — using non-standard protocols and ports.\nDarknets are distinct from other distributed peer-to-peer networks as sharing is anonymous (that is, IP addresses are not publicly shared), and therefore users can communicate with little fear of governmental or corporate interference.[84]\n\nVirtual private networks[edit]\nA virtual private network (VPN) is an overlay network in which some of the links between nodes are carried by open connections or virtual circuits in some larger network (e.g., the Internet) instead of by physical wires. The data link layer protocols of the virtual network are said to be tunneled through the larger network. One common application is secure communications through the public Internet, but a VPN need not have explicit security features, such as authentication or content encryption. VPNs, for example, can be used to separate the traffic of different user communities over an underlying network with strong security features.\n\n\nNetwork services are applications hosted by servers on a computer network, to provide some functionality for members or users of the network, or to help the network itself to operate.\nThe World Wide Web, E-mail,[85] printing and network file sharing are examples of well-known network services. Network services such as Domain Name System (DNS) give names for IP and MAC addresses (people remember names like nm.lan better than numbers like 210.121.67.18),[86] and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) to ensure that the equipment on the network has a valid IP address.[87]\nServices are usually based on a service protocol that defines the format and sequencing of messages between clients and servers of that network service.\n\n\n\nBandwidth in bit/s may refer to consumed bandwidth, corresponding to achieved throughput or goodput, i.e., the average rate of successful data transfer through a communication path. The throughput is affected by processes such as bandwidth shaping, bandwidth management, bandwidth throttling, bandwidth cap and bandwidth allocation (using, for example, bandwidth allocation protocol and dynamic bandwidth allocation).\n\n\n\nNetwork delay is a design and performance characteristic of a telecommunications network. It specifies the latency for a bit of data to travel across the network from one communication endpoint to another. Delay may differ slightly, depending on the location of the specific pair of communicating endpoints. Engineers usually report both the maximum and average delay, and they divide the delay into several components, the sum of which is the total delay:\n\nProcessing delay –  time it takes a router to process the packet header\nQueuing delay –  time the packet spends in routing queues\nTransmission delay –  time it takes to push the packet's bits onto the link\nPropagation delay –  time for a signal to propagate through the media\nA certain minimum level of delay is experienced by signals due to the time it takes to transmit a packet serially through a link. This delay is extended by more variable levels of delay due to network congestion. IP network delays can range from less than a microsecond to several hundred milliseconds.\n\nPerformance metrics[edit]\nThe parameters that affect performance typically can include throughput, jitter, bit error rate and latency.\nIn circuit-switched networks, network performance is synonymous with the grade of service. The number of rejected calls is a measure of how well the network is performing under heavy traffic loads.[88] Other types of performance measures can include the level of noise and echo.\nIn an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) network, performance can be measured by line rate, quality of service (QoS), data throughput, connect time, stability, technology, modulation technique, and modem enhancements.[89][verification needed][full citation needed]\nThere are many ways to measure the performance of a network, as each network is different in nature and design. Performance can also be modeled instead of measured. For example, state transition diagrams are often used to model queuing performance in a circuit-switched network. The network planner uses these diagrams to analyze how the network performs in each state, ensuring that the network is optimally designed.[90]\n\n\nNetwork congestion occurs when a link or node is subjected to a greater data load than it is rated for, resulting in a deterioration of its quality of service. When networks are congested and queues become too full, packets have to be discarded, and participants must rely on retransmission to maintain reliable communications. Typical effects of congestion include queueing delay, packet loss or the blocking of new connections. A consequence of these latter two is that incremental increases in offered load lead either to only a small increase in the network throughput or to a potential reduction in network throughput.\nNetwork protocols that use aggressive retransmissions to compensate for packet loss tend to keep systems in a state of network congestion even after the initial load is reduced to a level that would not normally induce network congestion. Thus, networks using these protocols can exhibit two stable states under the same level of load. The stable state with low throughput is known as congestive collapse.\nModern networks use congestion control, congestion avoidance and traffic control techniques where endpoints typically slow down or sometimes even stop transmission entirely when the network is congested to try to avoid congestive collapse. Specific techniques include: exponential backoff in protocols such as 802.11's CSMA/CA and the original Ethernet, window reduction in TCP, and fair queueing in devices such as routers.\nAnother method to avoid the negative effects of network congestion is implementing quality of service priority schemes allowing selected traffic to bypass congestion. Priority schemes do not solve network congestion by themselves, but they help to alleviate the effects of congestion for critical services. A third method to avoid network congestion is the explicit allocation of network resources to specific flows. One example of this is the use of Contention-Free Transmission Opportunities (CFTXOPs) in the ITU-T G.hn home networking standard.\nFor the Internet, RFC 2914 addresses the subject of congestion control in detail.\n\n\nNetwork resilience is \"the ability to provide and maintain an acceptable level of service in the face of faults and challenges to normal operation.\"[91]\n\n\nComputer networks are also used by security hackers to deploy computer viruses or computer worms on devices connected to the network, or to prevent these devices from accessing the network via a denial-of-service attack.\n\n\nNetwork Security consists of provisions and policies adopted by the network administrator to prevent and monitor unauthorized access, misuse, modification, or denial of the computer network and its network-accessible resources.[92] Network security is used on a variety of computer networks, both public and private, to secure daily transactions and communications among businesses, government agencies, and individuals.\n\nNetwork surveillance[edit]\nNetwork surveillance is the monitoring of data being transferred over computer networks such as the Internet. The monitoring is often done surreptitiously and may be done by or at the behest of governments, by corporations, criminal organizations, or individuals. It may or may not be legal and may or may not require authorization from a court or other independent agency.\nComputer and network surveillance programs are widespread today, and almost all Internet traffic is or could potentially be monitored for clues to illegal activity.\nSurveillance is very useful to governments and law enforcement to maintain social control, recognize and monitor threats, and prevent or investigate criminal activity. With the advent of programs such as the Total Information Awareness program, technologies such as high-speed surveillance computers and biometrics software, and laws such as the Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act, governments now possess an unprecedented ability to monitor the activities of citizens.[93]\nHowever, many civil rights and privacy groups—such as Reporters Without Borders, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and the American Civil Liberties Union—have expressed concern that increasing surveillance of citizens may lead to a mass surveillance society, with limited political and personal freedoms. Fears such as this have led to lawsuits such as Hepting v. AT&T.[93][94] The hacktivist group Anonymous has hacked into government websites in protest of what it considers \"draconian surveillance\".[95][96]\n\nEnd to end encryption[edit]\nEnd-to-end encryption (E2EE) is a digital communications paradigm of uninterrupted protection of data traveling between two communicating parties. It involves the originating party encrypting data so only the intended recipient can decrypt it, with no dependency on third parties. End-to-end encryption prevents intermediaries, such as Internet service providers or application service providers, from reading or tampering with communications. End-to-end encryption generally protects both confidentiality and integrity.\nExamples of end-to-end encryption include HTTPS for web traffic, PGP for email, OTR for instant messaging, ZRTP for telephony, and TETRA for radio.\nTypical server-based communications systems do not include end-to-end encryption. These systems can only guarantee the protection of communications between clients and servers, not between the communicating parties themselves. Examples of non-E2EE systems are Google Talk, Yahoo Messenger, Facebook, and Dropbox.\nThe end-to-end encryption paradigm does not directly address risks at the endpoints of the communication themselves, such as the technical exploitation of clients, poor quality random number generators, or key escrow. E2EE also does not address traffic analysis, which relates to things such as the identities of the endpoints and the times and quantities of messages that are sent.\n\n\n\nThe introduction and rapid growth of e-commerce on the World Wide Web in the mid-1990s made it obvious that some form of authentication and encryption was needed. Netscape took the first shot at a new standard. At the time, the dominant web browser was Netscape Navigator. Netscape created a standard called secure socket layer (SSL). SSL requires a server with a certificate. When a client requests access to an SSL-secured server, the server sends a copy of the certificate to the client. The SSL client checks this certificate (all web browsers come with an exhaustive list of root certificates preloaded), and if the certificate checks out, the server is authenticated and the client negotiates a symmetric-key cipher for use in the session. The session is now in a very secure encrypted tunnel between the SSL server and the SSL client.[65]\n\n\n\nCloud computing\nCyberspace\nDistributed computing\nHistory of the Internet\nInformation Age\nISO/IEC 11801 – International standard for electrical and optical cables\nNetwork diagram software\nNetwork mapping\nNetwork on a chip\nNetwork planning and design\nNetwork simulation\n\n\n^ Peterson, Larry; Davie, Bruce (2000).

Although there was considerable technical interchange between the NPL group and those who designed and implemented the ARPANET, the NPL Data Network effort appears to have had little fundamental impact on the design of ARPANET. Such major aspects of the NPL Data Network design as the standard network interface, the routing algorithm, and the software structure of the switching node were largely ignored by the ARPANET designers. There is no doubt, however, that in many less fundamental ways the NPL Data Network had and effect on the design and evolution of the ARPANET.\n\n^ Heart, F.; McKenzie, A.; McQuillian, J.; Walden, D.

    "content": "Flowchart of using successive subtractions to find the greatest common divisor of number r and s\nIn mathematics and computer science, an algorithm () is a finite sequence of mathematically rigorous instructions, typically used to solve a class of specific problems or to perform a computation.[1] Algorithms are used as specifications for performing calculations and data processing. More advanced algorithms can use conditionals to divert the code execution through various routes (referred to as automated decision-making) and deduce valid inferences (referred to as automated reasoning).\nIn contrast, a heuristic is an approach to solving problems without well-defined correct or optimal results.[2] For example, although social media recommender systems are commonly called \"algorithms\", they actually rely on heuristics as there is no truly \"correct\" recommendation.\nAs an effective method, an algorithm can be expressed within a finite amount of space and time[3] and in a well-defined formal language[4] for calculating a function.[5] Starting from an initial state and initial input (perhaps empty),[6] the instructions describe a computation that, when executed, proceeds through a finite[7] number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing \"output\"[8] and terminating at a final ending state. The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily deterministic; some algorithms, known as randomized algorithms, incorporate random input.[9]\n\n\n\nAround 825 AD, Persian scientist and polymath Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī wrote kitāb al-ḥisāb al-hindī (\"Book of Indian computation\") and kitab al-jam' wa'l-tafriq al-ḥisāb al-hindī (\"Addition and subtraction in Indian arithmetic\"). In the early 12th century, Latin translations of these texts involving the Hindu–Arabic numeral system and arithmetic appeared, for example Liber Alghoarismi de practica arismetrice, attributed to John of Seville, and Liber Algorismi de numero Indorum, attributed to Adelard of Bath.[10] Here, alghoarismi or algorismi is the Latinization of Al-Khwarizmi's name;[1] the text starts with the phrase Dixit Algorismi, or \"Thus spoke Al-Khwarizmi\".[2]\nThe word algorism in English came to mean the use of place-value notation in calculations; it occurs in the Ancrene Wisse from circa 1225.[11] By the time Geoffrey Chaucer wrote The Canterbury Tales in the late 14th century, he used a variant of the same word in describing augrym stones, stones used for place-value calculation.[12][13] In the 15th century, under the influence of the Greek word ἀριθμός (arithmos, \"number\"; cf. \"arithmetic\"), the Latin word was altered to algorithmus.[14] By 1596, this form of the word was used in English, as algorithm, by Thomas Hood.[15]\n\n\nFor a detailed presentation of the various points of view on the definition of \"algorithm\", see Algorithm characterizations.\nOne informal definition is \"a set of rules that precisely defines a sequence of operations\",[16] which would include all computer programs (including programs that do not perform numeric calculations), and any prescribed bureaucratic procedure[17]\nor cook-book recipe.[18] In general, a program is an algorithm only if it stops eventually[19]—even though infinite loops may sometimes prove desirable. Boolos, Jeffrey & 1974, 1999 define an algorithm to be an explicit set of instructions for determining an output, that can be followed by a computing machine or a human who could only carry out specific elementary operations on symbols.[20]\nMost algorithms are intended to be implemented as computer programs. However, algorithms are also implemented by other means, such as in a biological neural network (for example, the human brain performing arithmetic or an insect looking for food), in an electrical circuit, or a mechanical device.\n\n\nThis section is missing information about 20th and 21st century development of computer algorithms.

(October 2023)\n\nStep-by-step procedures for solving mathematical problems have been recorded since antiquity. This includes in Babylonian mathematics (around 2500 BC),[21] Egyptian mathematics (around 1550 BC),[21] Indian mathematics (around 800 BC and later),[22][23] the Ifa Oracle (around 500 BC),[24] Greek mathematics (around 240 BC),[25] Chinese mathematics (around 200 BC and later),[26] and Arabic mathematics (around 800 AD).[27]\nThe earliest evidence of algorithms is found in ancient Mesopotamian mathematics. A Sumerian clay tablet found in Shuruppak near Baghdad and dated to c. 2500 BC describes the earliest division algorithm.[21] During the Hammurabi dynasty c. 1800 – c. 1600 BC, Babylonian clay tablets described algorithms for computing formulas.[28] Algorithms were also used in Babylonian astronomy. Babylonian clay tablets describe and employ algorithmic procedures to compute the time and place of significant astronomical events.[29]\nAlgorithms for arithmetic are also found in ancient Egyptian mathematics, dating back to the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus c. 1550 BC.[21] Algorithms were later used in ancient Hellenistic mathematics. Two examples are the Sieve of Eratosthenes, which was described in the Introduction to Arithmetic by Nicomachus,[30][25]: Ch 9.2  and the Euclidean algorithm, which was first described in Euclid's Elements (c. 300 BC).[25]: Ch 9.1 Examples of ancient Indian mathematics included the Shulba Sutras, the Kerala School, and the Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta.[22]\nThe first cryptographic algorithm for deciphering encrypted code was developed by Al-Kindi, a 9th-century Arab mathematician, in A Manuscript On Deciphering Cryptographic Messages. He gave the first description of cryptanalysis by frequency analysis, the earliest codebreaking algorithm.[27]\n\n\nWeight-driven clocks[edit]\nBolter credits the invention of the weight-driven clock as \"the key invention [of Europe in the Middle Ages],\" specifically the verge escapement mechanism[31] producing the tick and tock of a mechanical clock. \"The accurate automatic machine\"[32] led immediately to \"mechanical automata\" in the 13th century and \"computational machines\"—the difference and analytical engines of Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace in the mid-19th century.[33] Lovelace designed the first algorithm intended for processing on a computer, Babbage's analytical engine, which is the first device considered a real Turing-complete computer instead of just a calculator. Although the full implementation of Babbage's second device was not realized for decades after her lifetime, Lovelace has been called \"history's first programmer\".\n\nElectromechanical relay[edit]\nBell and Newell (1971) write that the Jacquard loom, a precursor to Hollerith cards (punch cards), and \"telephone switching technologies\" led to the development of the first computers.[34] By the mid-19th century, the telegraph, the precursor of the telephone, was in use throughout the world. By the late 19th century, the ticker tape (c. 1870s) was in use, as were Hollerith cards (c. 1890). Then came the teleprinter (c. 1910) with its punched-paper use of Baudot code on tape.\nTelephone-switching networks of electromechanical relays were invented in 1835. These led to the invention of the digital adding device by George Stibitz in 1937. While working in Bell Laboratories, he observed the \"burdensome\" use of mechanical calculators with gears. \"He went home one evening in 1937 intending to test his idea... When the tinkering was over, Stibitz had constructed a binary adding device\".[35][36]\n\n\nAda Lovelace's diagram from \"Note G\", the first published computer algorithm\nIn 1928, a partial formalization of the modern concept of algorithms began with attempts to solve the Entscheidungsproblem (decision problem) posed by David Hilbert. Later formalizations were framed as attempts to define \"effective calculability\"[37] or \"effective method\".[38] Those formalizations included the Gödel–Herbrand–Kleene recursive functions of 1930, 1934 and 1935, Alonzo Church's lambda calculus of 1936, Emil Post's Formulation 1 of 1936, and Alan Turing's Turing machines of 1936–37 and 1939.\n\n\nAlgorithms have evolved and improved in many ways as time goes on. Common uses of algorithms today include social media apps like Instagram and YouTube. Algorithms are used as a way to analyze what people like and push more of those things to the people who interact with them. Quantum computing uses quantum algorithm procedures to solve problems faster. More recently, in 2024, NIST updated their post-quantum encryption standards, which includes new encryption algorithms to enhance defenses against attacks using quantum computing.\n\n\nAlgorithms can be expressed in many kinds of notation, including natural languages, pseudocode, flowcharts, drakon-charts, programming languages or control tables (processed by interpreters). Natural language expressions of algorithms tend to be verbose and ambiguous and are rarely used for complex or technical algorithms. Pseudocode, flowcharts, drakon-charts, and control tables are structured expressions of algorithms that avoid common ambiguities of natural language. Programming languages are primarily for expressing algorithms in a computer-executable form but are also used to define or document algorithms.\n\n\nThere are many possible representations and Turing machine programs can be expressed as a sequence of machine tables (see finite-state machine, state-transition table, and control table for more), as flowcharts and drakon-charts (see state diagram for more), as a form of rudimentary machine code or assembly code called \"sets of quadruples\", and more. Algorithm representations can also be classified into three accepted levels of Turing machine description: high-level description, implementation description, and formal description.[39] A high-level description describes the qualities of the algorithm itself, ignoring how it is implemented on the Turing machine.[39] An implementation description describes the general manner in which the machine moves its head and stores data to carry out the algorithm, but does not give exact states.[39] In the most detail, a formal description gives the exact state table and list of transitions of the Turing machine.[39]\n\nFlowchart representation[edit]\nThe graphical aid called a flowchart offers a way to describe and document an algorithm (and a computer program corresponding to it). It has four primary symbols: arrows showing program flow, rectangles (SEQUENCE, GOTO), diamonds (IF-THEN-ELSE), and dots (OR-tie). Sub-structures can \"nest\" in rectangles, but only if a single exit occurs from the superstructure.\n\nAlgorithmic analysis[edit]\n\nIt is often important to know how much time, storage, or other cost an algorithm may require. Methods have been developed for the analysis of algorithms to obtain such quantitative answers (estimates); for example, an algorithm that adds up the elements of a list of n numbers would have a time requirement of ⁠⁠, using big O notation. The algorithm only needs to remember two values: the sum of all the elements so far, and its current position in the input list. If the space required to store the input numbers is not counted, it has a space requirement of ⁠⁠, otherwise ⁠⁠ is required.\nDifferent algorithms may complete the same task with a different set of instructions in less or more time, space, or 'effort' than others. For example, a binary search algorithm (with cost ⁠⁠) outperforms a sequential search (cost ⁠⁠ ) when used for table lookups on sorted lists or arrays.\n\nFormal versus empirical[edit]\n\nThe analysis, and study of algorithms is a discipline of computer science. Algorithms are often studied abstractly, without referencing any specific programming language or implementation. Algorithm analysis resembles other mathematical disciplines as it focuses on the algorithm's properties, not implementation. Pseudocode is typical for analysis as it is a simple and general representation. Most algorithms are implemented on particular hardware/software platforms and their algorithmic efficiency is tested using real code. The efficiency of a particular algorithm may be insignificant for many \"one-off\" problems but it may be critical for algorithms designed for fast interactive, commercial, or long-life scientific usage. Scaling from small n to large n frequently exposes inefficient algorithms that are otherwise benign.\nEmpirical testing is useful for uncovering unexpected interactions that affect performance. Benchmarks may be used to compare before/after potential improvements to an algorithm after program optimization.\nEmpirical tests cannot replace formal analysis, though, and are non-trivial to perform fairly.[40]\n\nExecution efficiency[edit]\n\nTo illustrate the potential improvements possible even in well-established algorithms, a recent significant innovation, relating to FFT algorithms (used heavily in the field of image processing), can decrease processing time up to 1,000 times for applications like medical imaging.[41] In general, speed improvements depend on special properties of the problem, which are very common in practical applications.[42] Speedups of this magnitude enable computing devices that make extensive use of image processing (like digital cameras and medical equipment) to consume less power.\n\nBest Case and Worst Case[edit]\n\nThe best case of an algorithm refers to the scenario or input for which the algorithm or data structure takes the least time and resources to complete its tasks.[43]  The worst case of an algorithm is the case that causes the algorithm or data structure to consume the maximum period of time and computational resources.[44]\n\n\nSee also: Algorithm § By design paradigm\nAlgorithm design is a method or mathematical process for problem-solving and engineering algorithms. The design of algorithms is part of many solution theories, such as divide-and-conquer or dynamic programming within operation research. Techniques for designing and implementing algorithm designs are also called algorithm design patterns,[45] with examples including the template method pattern and the decorator pattern. One of the most important aspects of algorithm design is resource (run-time, memory usage) efficiency; the big O notation is used to describe e.g., an algorithm's run-time growth as the size of its input increases.[46]\n\nStructured programming[edit]\nPer the Church–Turing thesis, any algorithm can be computed by any Turing complete model. Turing completeness only requires four instruction types—conditional GOTO, unconditional GOTO, assignment, HALT. However, Kemeny and Kurtz observe that, while \"undisciplined\" use of unconditional GOTOs and conditional IF-THEN GOTOs can result in \"spaghetti code\", a programmer can write structured programs using only these instructions; on the other hand \"it is also possible, and not too hard, to write badly structured programs in a structured language\".[47] Tausworthe augments the three Böhm-Jacopini canonical structures:[48] SEQUENCE, IF-THEN-ELSE, and WHILE-DO, with two more: DO-WHILE and CASE.[49] An additional benefit of a structured program is that it lends itself to proofs of correctness using mathematical induction.[50]\n\n\n\nBy themselves, algorithms are not usually patentable. In the United States, a claim consisting solely of simple manipulations of abstract concepts, numbers, or signals does not constitute \"processes\" (USPTO 2006), so algorithms are not patentable (as in Gottschalk v. Benson). However practical applications of algorithms are sometimes patentable. For example, in Diamond v. Diehr, the application of a simple feedback algorithm to aid in the curing of synthetic rubber was deemed patentable. The patenting of software is controversial,[51] and there are criticized patents involving algorithms, especially data compression algorithms, such as Unisys's LZW patent. Additionally, some cryptographic algorithms have export restrictions (see export of cryptography).\n\n\n\nRecursion\nA recursive algorithm invokes itself repeatedly until meeting a termination condition and is a common functional programming method. Iterative algorithms use repetitions such as loops or data structures like stacks to solve problems. Problems may be suited for one implementation or the other. The Tower of Hanoi is a puzzle commonly solved using recursive implementation. Every recursive version has an equivalent (but possibly more or less complex) iterative version, and vice versa.\nSerial, parallel or distributed\nAlgorithms are usually discussed with the assumption that computers execute one instruction of an algorithm at a time on serial computers. Serial algorithms are designed for these environments, unlike parallel or distributed algorithms. Parallel algorithms take advantage of computer architectures where multiple processors can work on a problem at the same time. Distributed algorithms use multiple machines connected via a computer network. Parallel and distributed algorithms divide the problem into subproblems and collect the results back together. Resource consumption in these algorithms is not only processor cycles on each processor but also the communication overhead between the processors. Some sorting algorithms can be parallelized efficiently, but their communication overhead is expensive. Iterative algorithms are generally parallelizable, but some problems have no parallel algorithms and are called inherently serial problems.\nDeterministic or non-deterministic\nDeterministic algorithms solve the problem with exact decisions at every step; whereas non-deterministic algorithms solve problems via guessing. Guesses are typically made more accurate through the use of heuristics.\nExact or approximate\nWhile many algorithms reach an exact solution, approximation algorithms seek an approximation that is close to the true solution. Such algorithms have practical value for many hard problems. For example, the Knapsack problem, where there is a set of items, and the goal is to pack the knapsack to get the maximum total value. Each item has some weight and some value. The total weight that can be carried is no more than some fixed number X. So, the solution must consider the weights of items as well as their value.[52]\nQuantum algorithm\nQuantum algorithms run on a realistic model of quantum computation. The term is usually used for those algorithms that seem inherently quantum or use some essential feature of Quantum computing such as quantum superposition or quantum entanglement.\n\nAnother way of classifying algorithms is by their design methodology or paradigm. Some common paradigms are:\n\nBrute-force or exhaustive search\nBrute force is a problem-solving method of systematically trying every possible option until the optimal solution is found. This approach can be very time-consuming, testing every possible combination of variables. It is often used when other methods are unavailable or too complex. Brute force can solve a variety of problems, including finding the shortest path between two points and cracking passwords.\nDivide and conquer\nA divide-and-conquer algorithm repeatedly reduces a problem to one or more smaller instances of itself (usually recursively) until the instances are small enough to solve easily. Merge sorting is an example of divide and conquer, where an unordered list is repeatedly split into smaller lists, which are sorted in the same way and then merged.[53] In a simpler variant of divide and conquer called prune and search or decrease-and-conquer algorithm, which solves one smaller instance of itself, and does not require a merge step.[54] An example of a prune and search algorithm is the binary search algorithm.\nSearch and enumeration\nMany problems (such as playing chess) can be modelled as problems on graphs. A graph exploration algorithm specifies rules for moving around a graph and is useful for such problems. This category also includes search algorithms, branch and bound enumeration, and backtracking.\nRandomized algorithm\nSuch algorithms make some choices randomly (or pseudo-randomly). They find approximate solutions when finding exact solutions may be impractical (see heuristic method below). For some problems, the fastest approximations must involve some randomness.[55] Whether randomized algorithms with polynomial time complexity can be the fastest algorithm for some problems is an open question known as the P versus NP problem. There are two large classes of such algorithms:\nMonte Carlo algorithms return a correct answer with high probability. E.g. RP is the subclass of these that run in polynomial time.\nLas Vegas algorithms always return the correct answer, but their running time is only probabilistically bound, e.g. ZPP.\nReduction of complexity\nThis technique transforms difficult problems into better-known problems solvable with (hopefully) asymptotically optimal algorithms. The goal is to find a reducing algorithm whose complexity is not dominated by the resulting reduced algorithms. For example, one selection algorithm finds the median of an unsorted list by first sorting the list (the expensive portion), and then pulling out the middle element in the sorted list (the cheap portion). This technique is also known as transform and conquer.\nBack tracking\nIn this approach, multiple solutions are built incrementally and abandoned when it is determined that they cannot lead to a valid full solution.\nOptimization problems[edit]\nFor optimization problems there is a more specific classification of algorithms; an algorithm for such problems may fall into one or more of the general categories described above as well as into one of the following:\n\nLinear programming\nWhen searching for optimal solutions to a linear function bound by linear equality and inequality constraints, the constraints can be used directly to produce optimal solutions. There are algorithms that can solve any problem in this category, such as the popular simplex algorithm.[56] Problems that can be solved with linear programming include the maximum flow problem for directed graphs. If a problem also requires that any of the unknowns be integers, then it is classified in integer programming. A linear programming algorithm can solve such a problem if it can be proved that all restrictions for integer values are superficial, i.e., the solutions satisfy these restrictions anyway. In the general case, a specialized algorithm or an algorithm that finds approximate solutions is used, depending on the difficulty of the problem.\nDynamic programming\nWhen a problem shows optimal substructures—meaning the optimal solution can be constructed from optimal solutions to subproblems—and overlapping subproblems, meaning the same subproblems are used to solve many different problem instances, a quicker approach called dynamic programming avoids recomputing solutions. For example, Floyd–Warshall algorithm, the shortest path between a start and goal vertex in a weighted graph can be found using the shortest path to the goal from all adjacent vertices. Dynamic programming and memoization go together. Unlike divide and conquer, dynamic programming subproblems often overlap. The difference between dynamic programming and simple recursion is the caching or memoization of recursive calls. When subproblems are independent and do not repeat, memoization does not help; hence dynamic programming is not applicable to all complex problems. Using memoization dynamic programming reduces the complexity of many problems from exponential to polynomial.\nThe greedy method\nGreedy algorithms, similarly to a dynamic programming, work by examining substructures, in this case not of the problem but of a given solution. Such algorithms start with some solution and improve it by making small modifications. For some problems, they always find the optimal solution but for others they may stop at local optima. The most popular use of greedy algorithms is finding minimal spanning trees of graphs without negative cycles. Huffman Tree, Kruskal, Prim, Sollin are greedy algorithms that can solve this optimization problem.\nThe heuristic method\nIn optimization problems, heuristic algorithms find solutions close to the optimal solution when finding the optimal solution is impractical. These algorithms get closer and closer to the optimal solution as they progress. In principle, if run for an infinite amount of time, they will find the optimal solution. They can ideally find a solution very close to the optimal solution in a relatively short time. These algorithms include local search, tabu search, simulated annealing, and genetic algorithms. Some, like simulated annealing, are non-deterministic algorithms while others, like tabu search, are deterministic. When a bound on the error of the non-optimal solution is known, the algorithm is further categorized as an approximation algorithm.\n\n\nOne of the simplest algorithms finds the largest number in a list of numbers of random order. Finding the solution requires looking at every number in the list. From this follows a simple algorithm, which can be described in plain English as:\nHigh-level description:\n\nIf a set of numbers is empty, then there is no highest number.\nAssume the first number in the set is the largest.\nFor each remaining number in the set: if this number is greater than the current largest, it becomes the new largest.\nWhen there are no unchecked numbers left in the set, consider the current largest number to be the largest in the set.\n(Quasi-)formal description:\nWritten in prose but much closer to the high-level language of a computer program, the following is the more formal coding of the algorithm in pseudocode or pidgin code:\n\n\nAlgorithm LargestNumber\nInput: A list of numbers L.\nOutput: The largest number in the list L.\n\nif L.size = 0 return null\nlargest ← L[0]\nfor each item in L, do\n    if item > largest, then\n        largest ← item\nreturn largest\n\n\"←\" denotes assignment.  For instance, \"largest ← item\" means that the value of largest changes to the value of item.\n\"return\" terminates the algorithm and outputs the following value.\n\n\n\n\nAbstract machine\nALGOL\nAlgorithm = Logic + Control\nAlgorithm aversion\nAlgorithm engineering\nAlgorithm characterizations\nAlgorithmic bias\nAlgorithmic composition\nAlgorithmic entities\nAlgorithmic synthesis\nAlgorithmic technique\nAlgorithmic topology\nComputational mathematics\nGarbage in, garbage out\nIntroduction to Algorithms (textbook)\nGovernment by algorithm\nList of algorithms\nList of algorithm books\nList of algorithm general topics\nMedium is the message\nRegulation of algorithms\nTheory of computation\nComputability theory\nComputational complexity theory\n\n\n\n^ a b \"Definition of ALGORITHM\".

    "content": "Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network).[1] Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.\nAmong Web professionals, \"Web development\" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web sites: writing markup and coding.[2] Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.\nFor larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of people (Web developers) and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing Web sites.[1] Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to related job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems technician. Web development may be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. There are three kinds of Web developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack developer.[3] Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user browser, while back-end developers deal with the servers.[4] Since the commercialization of the Web, the industry has boomed and has become one of the most used technologies ever.\n\n\nEvolution of the World Wide Web and web development\nOrigin/ Web 1.0\nTim Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web in 1989 at CERN.[5]\nThe primary goal in the development of the Web was to fulfill the automated information-sharing needs of academics affiliated with institutions and various global organizations. Consequently, HTML was developed in 1993.[6]\nWeb 1.0 is described as the first paradigm wherein users could only view material and provide a small amount of information.[7] Core protocols of web 1.0 were HTTP, HTML and URI.[8]\n\nWeb 2.0\nWeb 2.0, a term popularised by Dale Dougherty, then vice president of O'Reilly, during a 2004 conference with Media Live, marks a shift in internet usage, emphasizing interactivity.[9][10]\nWeb 2.0 introduced increased user engagement and communication. It evolved from the static, read-only nature of Web 1.0 and became an integrated network for engagement and communication. It is often referred to as a user-focused, read-write online network.[7]\nIn the realm of Web 2.0 environments, users now have access to a platform that encourages sharing activities such as creating music, files, images, and movies.[11] The architecture of Web 2.0 is often considered the \"backbone of the internet,\" using standardized XML (Extensible Markup Language) tags to authorize information flow from independent platforms and online databases.[7]\n\nWeb 3.0\nWeb 3.0, considered the third and current version of the web, was introduced in 2014. The concept envisions a complete redesign of the web. Key features include the integration of metadata, precise information delivery, and improved user experiences based on preferences, history, and interests.[citation needed]\nWeb 3.0 aims to turn the web into a sizable, organized database, providing more functionality than traditional search engines. Users can customize navigation based on their preferences, and the core ideas involve identifying data sources, connecting them for efficiency, and creating user profiles.[7]\nThis version is sometimes also known as Semantic Web.[12]\n\nEvolution of web development technologies\nThe journey of web development technologies began with simple HTML pages in the early days of the internet. Over time, advancements led to the incorporation of CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity. This evolution transformed static websites into dynamic and responsive platforms, setting the stage for the complex and feature-rich web applications we have today.\n\nStatic HTML Pages (1990s)\nIntroduction of CSS (late 1990s)[13]\nJavaScript and Dynamic HTML (1990s - early 2000s)[14][15]\nAJAX (1998)[16]\nRise of Content management systems (CMS) (mid-2000s)\nMobile web (late 2000s - 2010s)\nSingle-page applications (SPAs) and front-end frameworks (2010s)\nServer-side javaScript (2010s)\nMicroservices and API-driven development (2010s - present)\nProgressive web apps (PWAs) (2010s - present)\nJAMstack Architecture (2010s - present)\nWebAssembly (Wasm) (2010s - present)\nServerless computing (2010s - present)\nAI and machine learning integration (2010s - present)\nWeb development in future will be driven by advances in browser technology, Web internet infrastructure, protocol standards, software engineering methods, and application trends.[8]\n\nWeb development life cycle\n\n\nThe web development life cycle is a method that outlines the stages involved in building websites and web applications. It provides a structured approach, ensuring optimal results throughout the development process.[citation needed]\nA typical Web Development process can be divided into 7 steps.\n\nAnalysis\nDebra Howcraft and John Carroll proposed a methodology in which web development process can be divided into sequential steps. They mentioned different aspects of analysis.[17]\nPhase one involves crafting a web strategy and analyzing how a website can effectively achieve its goals. Keil et al.'s research[18] identifies the primary reasons for software project failures as a lack of top management commitment and misunderstandings of system requirements. To mitigate these risks, Phase One establishes strategic goals and objectives, designing a system to fulfill them. The decision to establish a web presence should ideally align with the organization's corporate information strategy.\nThe analysis phase can be divided into 3 steps:\n\nDevelopment of a web strategy\nDefining objectives\nObjective analysis\nDuring this phase, the previously outlined objectives and available resources undergo analysis to determine their feasibility. This analysis is divided into six tasks, as follows:\n\nTechnology analysis: Identification of all necessary technological components and tools for constructing, hosting, and supporting the site.\nInformation analysis: Identification of user-required information, whether static (web page) or dynamic (pulled \"live\" from a database server).\nSkills analysis: Identification of the diverse skill sets necessary to complete the project.\nUser analysis: Identification of all intended users of the site, a more intricate process due to the varied range of users and technologies they may use.\nCost analysis: Estimation of the development cost for the site or an evaluation of what is achievable within a predefined budget.\nRisk analysis: Examination of any major risks associated with site development.\nFollowing this analysis, a more refined set of objectives is documented. Objectives that cannot be presently fulfilled are recorded in a Wish List, constituting part of the Objectives Document. This documentation becomes integral to the iterative process during the subsequent cycle of the methodology.[17]\n\nPlanning: sitemap and wireframe\nIt is crucial for web developers to be engaged in formulating a plan and determining the optimal architecture and selecting the frameworks.[citation needed] Additionally, developers/consultants play a role in elucidating the total cost of ownership associated with supporting a website, which may surpass the initial development expenses.\nKey aspects in this step are:\n\nSitemap creation\nWireframe creation\nTech stack\nDesign and layout\nFollowing the analysis phase, the development process moves on to the design phase, which is guided by the objectives document. Recognizing the incremental growth of websites and the potential lack of good design architecture, the methodology includes iteration to account for changes and additions over the life of the site. The design phase, which is divided into Information Design and Graphic Design, results in a detailed Design Document that details the structure of the website, database data structures, and CGI scripts.*\nThe following step, design testing, focuses on early, low-cost testing to identify inconsistencies or flaws in the design. This entails comparing the website's design to the goals and objectives outlined in the first three steps. Phases One and Two involve an iterative loop in which objectives in the Objectives Document are revisited to ensure alignment with the design. Any objectives that are removed are added to the Wish List for future consideration.[17]\nKey aspects in this step are:\n\nPage layouts\nReview\nApproval\nContent creation\nNo matter how visually appealing a website is, good communication with clients is critical. The primary purpose of content production is to create a communication channel through the user interface by delivering relevant information about your firm in an engaging and easily understandable manner. This includes:[citation needed]\n\nDeveloping appealing calls to action\nMaking creative headlines\nContent formatting for readability\nCarrying out line editing\nText updating throughout the site development process.\nThe stage of content production is critical in establishing the branding and marketing of your website or web application. It serves as a platform for defining the purpose and goals of your online presence through compelling and convincing content.\n\nDevelopment\nDuring this critical stage, the website is built while keeping its fundamental goal in mind, paying close attention to all graphic components to assure the establishment of a completely working site.\nThe procedure begins with the development of the main page, which is followed by the production of interior pages. The site's navigational structure is being refined in particular.\nDuring this development phase, key functionality such as the Content Management System, interactive contact forms, and shopping carts are activated.\nThe coding process includes creating all of the site's software and installing it on the appropriate Web servers. This can range from simple things like posting to a Web server to more complex tasks like establishing database connections.\n\nTesting, review and launch\nIn any web project, the testing phase is incredibly intricate and difficult. Because web apps are frequently designed for a diverse and often unknown user base running in a range of technological environments, their complexity exceeds that of traditional Information Systems (IS). To ensure maximum reach and efficacy, the website must be tested in a variety of contexts and technologies. The website moves to the delivery stage after gaining final approval from the designer. To ensure its preparation for launch, the quality assurance team performs rigorous testing for functionality, compatibility, and performance.\nAdditional testing is carried out, including integration, stress, scalability, load, resolution, and cross-browser compatibility. When the approval is given, the website is pushed to the server via FTP, completing the development process.\nKey aspects in this step are:\n\nTest Lost Links\nUse code validators\nCheck browser\nMaintenance and updating\nThe web development process goes beyond deployment to include a variety of post-deployment tasks.\nWebsites, in example, are frequently under ongoing maintenance, with new items being uploaded on a daily basis. The maintenance costs increases immensely as the site grows in size. The accuracy of content on a website is critical, demanding continuous monitoring to verify that both information and links, particularly external links, are updated. Adjustments are made in response to user feedback, and regular support and maintenance actions are carried out to maintain the website's long-term effectiveness.[17]\n\nTraditional development methodologies\nDebra Howcraft and John Carroll discussed a few traditional web development methodologies in their research paper:[17]\n\nWaterfall: The waterfall methodology comprises a sequence of cascading steps, addressing the development process with minimal iteration between each stage. However, a significant drawback when applying the waterfall methodology to the development of websites (as well as information systems) lies in its rigid structure, lacking iteration beyond adjacent stages. Any methodology used for the development of Web-sites must be flexible enough to cope with change.[17]\nStructured Systems Analysis and Design Method (SSADM): Structured Systems Analysis and Design Method (SSADM) is a widely used methodology for systems analysis and design in information systems and software engineering. Although it does not cover the entire lifecycle of a development project, it places a strong emphasis on the stages of analysis and design in the hopes of minimizing later-stage, expensive errors and omissions.[17]\nPrototyping: Prototyping is a software development approach in which a preliminary version of a system or application is built to visualize and test its key functionalities. The prototype serves as a tangible representation of the final product, allowing stakeholders, including users and developers, to interact with it and provide feedback.\nRapid Application Development: Rapid Application Development (RAD) is a software development methodology that prioritizes speed and flexibility in the development process. It is designed to produce high-quality systems quickly, primarily through the use of iterative prototyping and the involvement of end-users. RAD aims to reduce the time it takes to develop a system and increase the adaptability to changing requirements.\nIncremental Prototyping: Incremental prototyping is a software development approach that combines the principles of prototyping and incremental development. In this methodology, the development process is divided into small increments, with each increment building upon the functionality of the previous one. At the same time, prototypes are created and refined in each increment to better meet user requirements and expectations.\nKey technologies in web development\nDeveloping a fundamental knowledge of client-side and server-side dynamics is crucial.[citation needed]\nThe goal of front-end development is to create a website's user interface and visual components that users may interact with directly. On the other hand, back-end development works with databases, server-side logic, and application functionality. Building reliable and user-friendly online applications requires a comprehensive approach, which is ensured by collaboration between front-end and back-end engineers.\n\nFront-end development\nFront-end development is the process of designing and implementing the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) of a web application. It involves creating visually appealing and interactive elements that users interact with directly. The primary technologies and concepts associated with front-end development include:\n\nTechnologies\nThe 3 core technologies for front-end development are:\n\nHTML (Hypertext Markup Language): HTML provides the structure and organization of content on a webpage.\nCSS (Cascading Style Sheet): Responsible for styling and layout, CSS enhances the presentation of HTML elements, making the application visually appealing.\nJavaScript: It is used to add interactions to the web pages. Advancement in JavaScript has given rise to many popular front- end frameworks like React, Angular and Vue.js etc.\nUser interface design\nUser experience design focuses on creating interfaces that are intuitive, accessible, and enjoyable for users. It involves understanding user behavior, conducting usability studies, and implementing design principles to enhance the overall satisfaction of users interacting with a website or application. This involves wireframing, prototyping, and implementing design principles to enhance user interaction. Some of the popular tools used for UI Wireframing are -\n\nSketch for detailed, vector-based design\nMoqups for beginners\nFigma for a free wireframe app\nUXPin for handing off design documentation to developers\nMockFlow for project organization\nJustinmind for interactive wireframes\nUizard for AI-assisted wireframing\nAnother key aspect to keep in mind while designing is Web Accessibility- Web accessibility ensures that digital content is available and usable for people of all abilities. This involves adhering to standards like the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), implementing features like alternative text for images, and designing with considerations for diverse user needs, including those with disabilities.\n\nResponsive design\nIt is important to ensure that web applications are accessible and visually appealing across various devices and screen sizes. Responsive design uses CSS media queries and flexible layouts to adapt to different viewing environments.\n\nFront-end frameworks\nA framework is a high-level solution for the reuse of software pieces, a step forward in simple library-based reuse that allows for sharing common functions and generic logic of a domain application.[19]\nFrameworks and libraries are essential tools that expedite the development process. These tools enhance developer productivity and contribute to the maintainability of large-scale applications. Some popular front-end frameworks are:\n\nReact: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, maintained by Facebook. It allows developers to create reusable UI components.\nAngular: A TypeScript-based front-end framework developed and maintained by Google. It provides a comprehensive solution for building dynamic single-page applications.\nVue.js: A progressive JavaScript framework that is approachable yet powerful, making it easy to integrate with other libraries or existing projects.\nState management\nManaging the state of a web application to ensure data consistency and responsiveness. State management libraries like Redux (for React) or Vuex (for Vue.js) play a crucial role in complex applications.\n\nBack-end development\nBack-end development involves building the server-side logic and database components of a web application. It is responsible for processing user requests, managing data, and ensuring the overall functionality of the application. Key aspects of back-end development include:\n\nServer/ cloud instance\nAn essential component of the architecture of a web application is a server or cloud instance. A cloud instance is a virtual server instance that can be accessed via the Internet and is created, delivered, and hosted on a public or private cloud. It functions as a physical server that may seamlessly move between various devices with ease or set up several instances on one server. It is therefore very dynamic, scalable, and economical.\n\nDatabases\nDatabase management is crucial for storing, retrieving, and managing data in web applications. Various database systems, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB, play distinct roles in organizing and structuring data. Effective database management ensures the responsiveness and efficiency of data-driven web applications. There are 3 types of databases:\n\nRelational databases: Structured databases that use tables to organize and relate data. Common Examples include - MySQL, PostgreSQL and many more.\nNoSQL databases: NoSQL databases are designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data and can be more flexible than relational databases. They come in various types, such as document-oriented, key-value stores, column-family stores, and graph databases. Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, ScyllaDB, CouchDB, Redis.\nDocument stores: Document stores store data in a semi-structured format, typically using JSON or XML documents. Each document can have a different structure, providing flexibility. Examples: MongoDB, CouchDB.\nKey-value stores: Key-value stores store data as pairs of keys and values. They are simple and efficient for certain types of operations, like caching. Examples: Redis, DynamoDB.\nColumn-family stores: Column-family stores organize data into columns instead of rows, making them suitable for large-scale distributed systems and analytical workloads. Examples: Apache Cassandra, HBase.\nGraph databases: Graph databases are designed to represent and query data in the form of graphs. They are effective for handling relationships and network-type data. Examples: Neo4j, Amazon Neptune.\nIn-memory databases: In-memory databases store data in the system's main memory (RAM) rather than on disk. This allows for faster data access and retrieval.  Examples: Redis, Memcached.\nTime-series databases: Time-series databases are optimized for handling time-stamped data, making them suitable for applications that involve tracking changes over time.  Examples: InfluxDB, OpenTSDB.\nNewSQL databases: NewSQL databases aim to provide the scalability of NoSQL databases while maintaining the ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) of traditional relational databases.  Examples: Google Spanner, CockroachDB.\nObject-oriented databases: Object-oriented databases store data in the form of objects, which can include both data and methods. They are designed to work seamlessly with object-oriented programming languages. Examples: db4o, ObjectDB.\nThe choice of a database depends on various factors such as the nature of the data, scalability requirements, performance considerations, and the specific use case of the application being developed. Each type of database has its strengths and weaknesses, and selecting the right one involves considering the specific needs of the project.\n\nApplication programming interface (APIs)\nApplication Programming Interfaces are sets of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. APIs define the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information.\n\nRESTful APIs and GraphQL are common approaches for defining and interacting with web services.\nTypes of APIs\nWeb APIs: These are APIs that are accessible over the internet using standard web protocols such as HTTP.  RESTful APIs are a common type of web API.\nLibrary APIs: These APIs provide pre-built functions and procedures that developers can use within their code.\nOperating System APIs: These APIs allow applications to interact with the underlying operating system, accessing features like file systems, hardware, and system services.\nServer-side languages\nProgramming languages aimed at server execution, as opposed to client browser execution, are known as server-side languages. These programming languages are used in web development to perform operations including data processing, database interaction, and the creation of dynamic content that is delivered to the client's browser. A key element of server-side programming is server-side scripting, which allows the server to react to client requests in real time.\nSome popular server-side languages are:\n\nPHP: PHP is a widely used, open-source server-side scripting language. It is embedded in HTML code and is particularly well-suited for web development.\nPython: Python is a versatile, high-level programming language used for a variety of purposes, including server-side web development. Frameworks like Django and Flask make it easy to build web applications in Python.\nRuby: Ruby is an object-oriented programming language, and it is commonly used for web development. Ruby on Rails is a popular web framework that simplifies the process of building web applications.\nJava: Java is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language. Java-based frameworks like Spring are commonly used for building enterprise-level web applications.\nNode.js (JavaScript): While JavaScript is traditionally a client-side language, Node.js enables developers to run JavaScript on the server side. It is known for its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it suitable for building scalable and high-performance applications.\nC# (C Sharp): C# is a programming language developed by Microsoft and is commonly used in conjunction with the .NET framework for building web applications on the Microsoft stack.\nASP.NET: ASP.NET is a web framework developed by Microsoft, and it supports languages like C# and VB.NET. It simplifies the process of building dynamic web applications.\nGo (Golang): Go is a statically typed language developed by Google. It is known for its simplicity and efficiency and is increasingly being used for building scalable and high-performance web applications.\nPerl: Perl is a versatile scripting language often used for web development. It is known for its powerful text-processing capabilities.\nSwift: Developed by Apple, Swift is used for server-side development in addition to iOS and macOS app development.\nLua: Lua is used for some embedded web servers, e.g. the configuration pages on a router, including OpenWRT.\nSecurity measures\nImplementing security measures to protect against common vulnerabilities, including SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF). Authentication and authorization mechanisms are crucial for securing data and user access.\n\nTesting, debugging and deployment\nThorough testing and debugging processes are essential for identifying and resolving issues in a web application. Testing may include unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing. Debugging involves pinpointing and fixing errors in the code, ensuring the reliability and stability of the application.\n\nUnit Testing: Testing individual components or functions to verify that they work as expected.\nIntegration Testing: Testing the interactions between different components or modules to ensure they function correctly together.\nContinuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD): CI/CD pipelines automate testing, deployment, and delivery processes, allowing for faster and more reliable releases.\nFull-stack development\nFull-stack development refers to the practice of designing, building, and maintaining the entire software stack of a web application. This includes both the frontend (client-side) and backend (server-side) components, as well as the database and any other necessary infrastructure. A full-stack developer is someone who has expertise in working with both the frontend and backend technologies, allowing them to handle all aspects of web application development.\n\nMEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js) and MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) are popular full-stack development stacks that streamline the development process by providing a cohesive set of technologies.\nWeb development tools and environments\nEfficient web development relies on a set of tools and environments that streamline the coding and collaboration processes:\n\nIntegrated development environments (IDEs): Tools like Visual Studio Code, Atom, and Sublime Text provide features such as code highlighting, autocompletion, and version control integration, enhancing the development experience.\nVersion control: Git is a widely used version control system that allows developers to track changes, collaborate seamlessly, and roll back to previous versions if needed.\nCollaboration tools: Communication platforms like Slack, project management tools such as Jira, and collaboration platforms like GitHub facilitate effective teamwork and project management.\nSecurity practices in web development\nSecurity is paramount in web development to protect against cyber threats and ensure the confidentiality and integrity of user data. Best practices include encryption, secure coding practices, regular security audits, and staying informed about the latest security vulnerabilities and patches.\n\nCommon threats: Developers must be aware of common security threats, including SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).\nSecure coding practices: Adhering to secure coding practices involves input validation, proper data sanitization, and ensuring that sensitive information is stored and transmitted securely.\nAuthentication and authorization: Implementing robust authentication mechanisms, such as OAuth or JSON Web Tokens (JWT), ensures that only authorized users can access specific resources within the application.\nAgile methodology in web development\nAgile manifesto and principles\nAgile is a set of principles and values for software development that prioritize flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction. The four key values are:\n\nIndividuals and interactions over processes and tools.\nWorking software over comprehensive documentation.\nCustomer collaboration over contract negotiation.\nResponding to change over following a plan.\nAgile concepts in web development\nIterative and incremental development: Building and refining a web application through small, repeatable cycles, enhancing features incrementally with each iteration.\nScrum and kanban: Employing agile frameworks like Scrum for structured sprints or Kanban for continuous flow to manage tasks and enhance team efficiency.\nCross-functional teams: Forming collaborative teams with diverse skill sets, ensuring all necessary expertise is present for comprehensive web development.\nCustomer collaboration: Engaging customers throughout the development process to gather feedback, validate requirements, and ensure the delivered product aligns with expectations.\nAdaptability to change: Embracing changes in requirements or priorities even late in the development process to enhance the product's responsiveness to evolving needs.\nUser stories and backlog: Capturing functional requirements through user stories and maintaining a backlog of prioritized tasks to guide development efforts.\nContinuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD): Implementing automated processes to continuously integrate code changes and deliver updated versions, ensuring a streamlined and efficient development pipeline.\n\nSee also\nOutline of web design and web development\nWeb design\nWeb development tools\nWeb application development\nWeb developer\nReferences\n\n^ a b \"What is Web Development? - Definition from Techopedia\".

    "content": "A diagram of the generation and common application of big data.\nBig data primarily refers to data sets that are too large or complex to be dealt with by traditional data-processing software. Data with many entries (rows) offer greater statistical power, while data with higher complexity (more attributes or columns) may lead to a higher false discovery rate.[1]\nBig data analysis challenges include capturing data, data storage, data analysis, search, sharing, transfer, visualization, querying, updating, information privacy, and data source. Big data was originally associated with three key concepts: volume, variety, and velocity.[2] The analysis of big data that have only volume velocity and variety can pose challenges in sampling. A fourth concept, veracity, that refers to the level of relaibility of data was thus added[3]. Without sufficient investment in expertise for big data veracity, the volume and variety of data can produce costs and risks that exceed an organization's capacity to create and capture value from big data.[4]\nCurrent usage of the term big data tends to refer to the use of predictive analytics, user behavior analytics, or certain other advanced data analytics methods that extract value from big data, and seldom to a particular size of data set. \"There is little doubt that the quantities of data now available are indeed large, but that's not the most relevant characteristic of this new data ecosystem.\"[5]\nAnalysis of data sets can find new correlations to \"spot business trends, prevent diseases, combat crime and so on\".[6] Scientists, business executives, medical practitioners, advertising and governments alike regularly meet difficulties with large data-sets in areas including Internet searches, fintech, healthcare analytics, geographic information systems, urban informatics, and business informatics. Scientists encounter limitations in e-Science work, including meteorology, genomics,[7] connectomics, complex physics simulations, biology, and environmental research.[8]\nThe size and number of available data sets have grown rapidly as data is collected by devices such as mobile devices, cheap and numerous information-sensing Internet of things devices, aerial (remote sensing) equipment, software logs, cameras, microphones, radio-frequency identification (RFID) readers and wireless sensor networks.[9][10] The world's technological per-capita capacity to store information has roughly doubled every 40 months since the 1980s;[11] as of 2012, every day 2.5 exabytes (2.17×260 bytes) of data are generated.[12] Based on an IDC report prediction, the global data volume was predicted to grow exponentially from 4.4 zettabytes to 44 zettabytes between 2013 and 2020. By 2025, IDC predicts there will be 163 zettabytes of data.[13] According to IDC, global spending on big data and business analytics (BDA) solutions is estimated to reach $215.7 billion in 2021.[14][15] Statista reported that the global big data market is forecasted to grow to $103 billion by 2027.[16] In 2011 McKinsey & Company reported, if US healthcare were to use big data creatively and effectively to drive efficiency and quality, the sector could create more than $300 billion in value every year.[17] In the developed economies of Europe, government administrators could save more than €100 billion ($149 billion) in operational efficiency improvements alone by using big data.[17] And users of services enabled by personal-location data could capture $600 billion in consumer surplus.[17] One question for large enterprises is determining who should own big-data initiatives that affect the entire organization.[18]\nRelational database management systems and desktop statistical software packages used to visualize data often have difficulty processing and analyzing big data. The processing and analysis of big data may require \"massively parallel software running on tens, hundreds, or even thousands of servers\".[19] What qualifies as \"big data\" varies depending on the capabilities of those analyzing it and their tools. Furthermore, expanding capabilities make big data a moving target. \"For some organizations, facing hundreds of gigabytes of data for the first time may trigger a need to reconsider data management options. For others, it may take tens or hundreds of terabytes before data size becomes a significant consideration.\"[20]\n\n\n\nThe term big data has been in use since the 1990s, with some giving credit to John Mashey for popularizing the term.[21][22]  Big data usually includes data sets with sizes beyond the ability of commonly used software tools to capture, curate, manage, and process data within a tolerable elapsed time.[23][page needed]  Big data philosophy encompasses unstructured, semi-structured and structured data; however, the main focus is on unstructured data.[24] Big data \"size\" is a constantly moving target; as of 2012 ranging from a few dozen terabytes to many zettabytes of data.[25]  Big data requires a set of techniques and technologies with new forms of integration to reveal insights from data-sets that are diverse, complex, and of a massive scale.[26] Variability is often included as an additional quality of big data.\nA 2018 definition states \"Big data is where parallel computing tools are needed to handle data\", and notes, \"This represents a distinct and clearly defined change in the computer science used, via parallel programming theories, and losses of some of the guarantees and capabilities made by Codd's relational model.\"[27]\nIn a comparative study of big datasets, Kitchin and McArdle found that none of the commonly considered characteristics of big data appear consistently across all of the analyzed cases.[28] For this reason, other studies identified the redefinition of power dynamics in knowledge discovery as the defining trait.[29] Instead of focusing on the intrinsic characteristics of big data, this alternative perspective pushes forward a relational understanding of the object claiming that what matters is the way in which data is collected, stored, made available and analyzed.\n\nBig data vs. business intelligence[edit]\nThe growing maturity of the concept more starkly delineates the difference between \"big data\" and \"business intelligence\":[30]\n\nBusiness intelligence uses applied mathematics tools and descriptive statistics with data with high information density to measure things, detect trends, etc.\nBig data uses mathematical analysis, optimization, inductive statistics, and concepts from nonlinear system identification[31] to infer laws (regressions, nonlinear relationships, and causal effects) from large sets of data with low information density[32] to reveal relationships and dependencies, or to perform predictions of outcomes and behaviors.[31][33][promotional source?]\n\nThis image shows the growth of big data's primary characteristics of volume, velocity, and variety.\nBig data can be described by the following characteristics:\n\nVolume\nThe quantity of generated and stored data. The size of the data determines the value and potential insight, and whether it can be considered big data or not. The size of big data is usually larger than terabytes and petabytes.[34]\nVariety\nThe type and nature of the data. Earlier technologies like RDBMSs were capable to handle structured data efficiently and effectively. However, the change in type and nature from structured to semi-structured or unstructured challenged the existing tools and technologies. Big data technologies evolved with the prime intention to capture, store, and process the semi-structured and unstructured (variety) data generated with high speed (velocity), and huge in size (volume). Later, these tools and technologies were explored and used for handling structured data also but preferable for storage. Eventually, the processing of structured data was still kept as optional, either using big data or traditional RDBMSs. This helps in analyzing data towards effective usage of the hidden insights exposed from the data collected via social media, log files, sensors, etc. Big data draws from text, images, audio, video; plus it completes missing pieces through data fusion.\nVelocity\nThe speed at which the data is generated and processed to meet the demands and challenges that lie in the path of growth and development. Big data is often available in real-time. Compared to small data, big data is produced more continually. Two kinds of velocity related to big data are the frequency of generation and the frequency of handling, recording, and publishing.[35]\nVeracity\nThe truthfulness or reliability of the data, which refers to the data quality and the data value.[36] Big data must not only be large in size, but also must be reliable in order to achieve value in the analysis of it. The data quality of captured data can vary greatly, affecting an accurate analysis.[37]\nValue\nThe worth in information that can be achieved by the processing and analysis of large datasets. Value also can be measured by an assessment of the other qualities of big data.[38] Value may also represent the profitability of information that is retrieved from the analysis of big data.\nVariability\nThe characteristic of the changing formats, structure, or sources of big data. Big data can include structured, unstructured, or combinations of structured and unstructured data. Big data analysis may integrate raw data from multiple sources. The processing of raw data may also involve transformations of unstructured data to structured data.\nOther possible characteristics of big data are:[39]\n\nExhaustive\nWhether the entire system (i.e., =all) is captured or recorded or not. Big data may or may not include all the available data from sources.\nFine-grained and uniquely lexical\nRespectively, the proportion of specific data of each element per element collected and if the element and its characteristics are properly indexed or identified.\nRelational\nIf the data collected contains common fields that would enable a conjoining, or meta-analysis, of different data sets.\nExtensional\nIf new fields in each element of the data collected can be added or changed easily.\nScalability\nIf the size of the big data storage system can expand rapidly.\n\nBig data repositories have existed in many forms, often built by corporations with a special need. Commercial vendors historically offered parallel database management systems for big data beginning in the 1990s. For many years, WinterCorp published the largest database report.[40][promotional source?]\nTeradata Corporation in 1984 marketed the parallel processing DBC 1012 system. Teradata systems were the first to store and analyze 1 terabyte of data in 1992. Hard disk drives were 2.5 GB in 1991 so the definition of big data continuously evolves. Teradata installed the first petabyte class RDBMS based system in 2007. As of 2017, there are a few dozen petabyte class Teradata relational databases installed, the largest of which exceeds 50 PB. Systems up until 2008 were 100% structured relational data. Since then, Teradata has added semi structured data types including XML, JSON, and Avro.\nIn 2000, Seisint Inc. (now LexisNexis Risk Solutions) developed a C++-based distributed platform for data processing and querying known as the HPCC Systems platform. This system automatically partitions, distributes, stores and delivers structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data across multiple commodity servers. Users can write data processing pipelines and queries in a declarative dataflow programming language called ECL. Data analysts working in ECL are not required to define data schemas upfront and can rather focus on the particular problem at hand, reshaping data in the best possible manner as they develop the solution. In 2004, LexisNexis acquired Seisint Inc.[41] and their high-speed parallel processing platform and successfully used this platform to integrate the data systems of Choicepoint Inc. when they acquired that company in 2008.[42] In 2011, the HPCC systems platform was open-sourced under the Apache v2.0 License.\nCERN and other physics experiments have collected big data sets for many decades, usually analyzed via high-throughput computing rather than the map-reduce architectures usually meant by the current \"big data\" movement.\nIn 2004, Google published a paper on a process called MapReduce that uses a similar architecture. The MapReduce concept provides a parallel processing model, and an associated implementation was released to process huge amounts of data. With MapReduce, queries are split and distributed across parallel nodes and processed in parallel (the \"map\" step). The results are then gathered and delivered (the \"reduce\" step). The framework was very successful,[43] so others wanted to replicate the algorithm. Therefore, an implementation of the MapReduce framework was adopted by an Apache open-source project named \"Hadoop\".[44] Apache Spark was developed in 2012 in response to limitations in the MapReduce paradigm, as it adds in-memory processing and the ability to set up many operations (not just map followed by reducing).\nMIKE2.0 is an open approach to information management that acknowledges the need for revisions due to big data implications identified in an article titled \"Big Data Solution Offering\".[45] The methodology addresses handling big data in terms of useful permutations of data sources, complexity in interrelationships, and difficulty in deleting (or modifying) individual records.[46]\nStudies in 2012 showed that a multiple-layer architecture was one option to address the issues that big data presents. A distributed parallel architecture distributes data across multiple servers; these parallel execution environments can dramatically improve data processing speeds. This type of architecture inserts data into a parallel DBMS, which implements the use of MapReduce and Hadoop frameworks. This type of framework looks to make the processing power transparent to the end-user by using a front-end application server.[47]\nThe data lake allows an organization to shift its focus from centralized control to a shared model to respond to the changing dynamics of information management. This enables quick segregation of data into the data lake, thereby reducing the overhead time.[48][49]\n\n\nA 2011 McKinsey Global Institute report characterizes the main components and ecosystem of big data as follows:[50]\n\nTechniques for analyzing data, such as A/B testing, machine learning, and natural language processing\nBig data technologies, like business intelligence, cloud computing, and databases\nVisualization, such as charts, graphs, and other displays of the data\nMultidimensional big data can also be represented as OLAP data cubes or, mathematically, tensors. Array database systems have set out to provide storage and high-level query support on this data type.\nAdditional technologies being applied to big data include efficient tensor-based computation,[51] such as multilinear subspace learning,[52] massively parallel-processing (MPP) databases, search-based applications, data mining,[53] distributed file systems, distributed cache (e.g., burst buffer and Memcached), distributed databases, cloud and HPC-based infrastructure (applications, storage and computing resources),[54] and the Internet.[citation needed] Although, many approaches and technologies have been developed, it still remains difficult to carry out machine learning with big data.[55]\nSome MPP relational databases have the ability to store and manage petabytes of data. Implicit is the ability to load, monitor, back up, and optimize the use of the large data tables in the RDBMS.[56][promotional source?]\nDARPA's Topological Data Analysis program seeks the fundamental structure of massive data sets and in 2008 the technology went public with the launch of a company called \"Ayasdi\".[57][independent source needed]\nThe practitioners of big data analytics processes are generally hostile to slower shared storage,[58] preferring direct-attached storage (DAS) in its various forms from solid state drive (SSD) to high capacity SATA disk buried inside parallel processing nodes. The perception of shared storage architectures—storage area network (SAN) and network-attached storage (NAS)— is that they are relatively slow, complex, and expensive. These qualities are not consistent with big data analytics systems that thrive on system performance, commodity infrastructure, and low cost.\nReal or near-real-time information delivery is one of the defining characteristics of big data analytics. Latency is therefore avoided whenever and wherever possible. Data in direct-attached memory or disk is good—data on memory or disk at the other end of an FC SAN connection is not. The cost of an SAN at the scale needed for analytics applications is much higher than other storage techniques.\n\n\nA graph showing the number of data points used to train notable AI systems from 1950 to 2025.[59]\nBig data has increased the demand of information management specialists so much so that Software AG, Oracle Corporation, IBM, Microsoft, SAP, EMC, HP, and Dell have spent more than $15 billion on software firms specializing in data management and analytics. In 2010, this industry was worth more than $100 billion and was growing at almost 10 percent a year, about twice as fast as the software business as a whole.[6]\nDeveloped economies increasingly use data-intensive technologies. There are 4.6 billion mobile-phone subscriptions worldwide, and between 1 billion and 2 billion people accessing the internet.[6] Between 1990 and 2005, more than 1 billion people worldwide entered the middle class, which means more people became more literate, which in turn led to information growth. The world's effective capacity to exchange information through telecommunication networks was 281 petabytes in 1986, 471 petabytes in 1993, 2.2 exabytes in 2000, 65 exabytes in 2007[11] and predictions put the amount of internet traffic at 667 exabytes annually by 2014.[6] According to one estimate, one-third of the globally stored information is in the form of alphanumeric text and still image data,[60] which is the format most useful for most big data applications. This also shows the potential of yet unused data (i.e. in the form of video and audio content).\nWhile many vendors offer off-the-shelf products for big data, experts promote the development of in-house custom-tailored systems if the company has sufficient technical capabilities.[61]\n\n\n\n\nThe use and adoption of big data within governmental processes allows efficiencies in terms of cost, productivity, and innovation,[62] but comes with flaws. Data analysis often requires multiple parts of government (central and local) to work in collaboration and create new and innovative processes to deliver the desired outcome. A common government organization that makes use of big data is the National Security Administration (NSA), which monitors the activities of the Internet constantly in search for potential patterns of suspicious or illegal activities their system may pick up.\nCivil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) collects all certificates status from birth to death. CRVS is a source of big data for governments.\n\nInternational development[edit]\nResearch on the effective usage of information and communication technologies for development (also known as \"ICT4D\") suggests that big data technology can make important contributions but also present unique challenges to international development.[63][64] Advancements in big data analysis offer cost-effective opportunities to improve decision-making in critical development areas such as health care, employment, economic productivity, crime, security, and natural disaster and resource management.[65][page needed][66][67] Additionally, user-generated data offers new opportunities to give the unheard a voice.[68] However, longstanding challenges for developing regions such as inadequate technological infrastructure and economic and human resource scarcity exacerbate existing concerns with big data such as privacy, imperfect methodology, and interoperability issues.[65][page needed]  The challenge of \"big data for development\"[65][page needed] is currently evolving toward the application of this data through machine learning, known as \"artificial intelligence for development (AI4D).[69]\n\n\nA major practical application of big data for development has been \"fighting poverty with data\".[70] In 2015, Blumenstock and colleagues estimated predicted poverty and wealth from mobile phone metadata[71] and in 2016 Jean and colleagues combined satellite imagery and machine learning to predict poverty.[72] Using digital trace data to study the labor market and the digital economy in Latin America, Hilbert and colleagues [73][74] argue that digital trace data has several benefits such as:\n\nThematic coverage: including areas that were previously difficult or impossible to measure\nGeographical coverage: providing sizable and comparable data for almost all countries, including many small countries that usually are not included in international inventories\nLevel of detail: providing fine-grained data with many interrelated variables, and new aspects, like network connections\nTimeliness and timeseries: graphs can be produced within days of being collected\n\nAt the same time, working with digital trace data instead of traditional survey data does not eliminate the traditional challenges involved when working in the field of international quantitative analysis. Priorities change, but the basic discussions remain the same. Among the main challenges are:\n\nRepresentativeness. While traditional development statistics is mainly concerned with the representativeness of random survey samples, digital trace data is never a random sample.[75]\nGeneralizability. While observational data always represents this source very well, it only represents what it represents, and nothing more. While it is tempting to generalize from specific observations of one platform to broader settings, this is often very deceptive.\nHarmonization. Digital trace data still requires international harmonization of indicators. It adds the challenge of so-called \"data-fusion\", the harmonization of different sources.\nData overload. Analysts and institutions are not used to effectively deal with a large number of variables, which is efficiently done with interactive dashboards. Practitioners still lack a standard workflow that would allow researchers, users and policymakers to efficiently and effectively deal with data.[73]\n\nBig Data is being rapidly adopted in Finance to 1) speed up processing and 2) deliver better, more informed inferences, both internally and to the clients of the financial institutions.[76] The financial applications of Big Data range from investing decisions and trading (processing volumes of available price data, limit order books, economic data and more, all at the same time), portfolio management (optimizing over an increasingly large array of financial instruments, potentially selected from different asset classes), risk management (credit rating based on extended information), and any other aspect where the data inputs are large.[77] Big Data has also been a typical concept within the field of alternative financial service. Some of the major areas involve crowd-funding platforms and crypto currency exchanges.[78]\n\n\nBig data analytics has been used in healthcare in providing personalized medicine and prescriptive analytics, clinical risk intervention and predictive analytics, waste and care variability reduction, automated external and internal reporting of patient data, standardized medical terms and patient registries.[79][80][81][82] Some areas of improvement are more aspirational than actually implemented. The level of data generated within healthcare systems is not trivial. With the added adoption of mHealth, eHealth and wearable technologies the volume of data will continue to increase. This includes electronic health record data, imaging data, patient generated data, sensor data, and other forms of difficult to process data. There is now an even greater need for such environments to pay greater attention to data and information quality.[83] \"Big data very often means 'dirty data' and the fraction of data inaccuracies increases with data volume growth.\" Human inspection at the big data scale is impossible and there is a desperate need in health service for intelligent tools for accuracy and believability control and handling of information missed.[84] While extensive information in healthcare is now electronic, it fits under the big data umbrella as most is unstructured and difficult to use.[85] The use of big data in healthcare has raised significant ethical challenges ranging from risks for individual rights, privacy and autonomy, to transparency and trust.[86]\nBig data in health research is particularly promising in terms of exploratory biomedical research, as data-driven analysis can move forward more quickly than hypothesis-driven research.[87] Then, trends seen in data analysis can be tested in traditional, hypothesis-driven follow up biological research and eventually clinical research.\nA related application sub-area, that heavily relies on big data, within the healthcare field is that of computer-aided diagnosis in medicine.[88][page needed]  For instance, for epilepsy monitoring it is customary to create 5 to 10 GB of data daily.[89] Similarly, a single uncompressed image of breast tomosynthesis averages 450 MB of data.[90]  These are just a few of the many examples where computer-aided diagnosis uses big data. For this reason, big data has been recognized as one of the seven key challenges that computer-aided diagnosis systems need to overcome in order to reach the next level of performance.[91]\n\n\nA McKinsey Global Institute study found a shortage of 1.5 million highly trained data professionals and managers[50] and a number of universities[92][better source needed] including University of Tennessee and UC Berkeley, have created masters programs to meet this demand. Private boot camps have also developed programs to meet that demand, including paid programs like The Data Incubator or General Assembly.[93] In the specific field of marketing, one of the problems stressed by Wedel and Kannan[94] is that marketing has several sub domains (e.g., advertising, promotions,\nproduct development, branding) that all use different types of data.\n\n\nTo understand how the media uses big data, it is first necessary to provide some context into the mechanism used for media process. It has been suggested by Nick Couldry and Joseph Turow that practitioners in media and advertising approach big data as many actionable points of information about millions of individuals. The industry appears to be moving away from the traditional approach of using specific media environments such as newspapers, magazines, or television shows and instead taps into consumers with technologies that reach targeted people at optimal times in optimal locations. The ultimate aim is to serve or convey, a message or content that is (statistically speaking) in line with the consumer's mindset. For example, publishing environments are increasingly tailoring messages (advertisements) and content (articles) to appeal to consumers that have been exclusively gleaned through various data-mining activities.[95]\n\nTargeting of consumers (for advertising by marketers)[96]\nData capture\nData journalism: publishers and journalists use big data tools to provide unique and innovative insights and infographics.\nChannel 4, the British public-service television broadcaster, is a leader in the field of big data and data analysis.[97]\n\n\nHealth insurance providers are collecting data on social \"determinants of health\" such as food and TV consumption, marital status, clothing size, and purchasing habits, from which they make predictions on health costs, in order to spot health issues in their clients. It is controversial whether these predictions are currently being used for pricing.[98]\n\nInternet of things (IoT)[edit]\n\n\nBig data and the IoT work in conjunction. Data extracted from IoT devices provides a mapping of device inter-connectivity. Such mappings have been used by the media industry, companies, and governments to more accurately target their audience and increase media efficiency. The IoT is also increasingly adopted as a means of gathering sensory data, and this sensory data has been used in medical,[99] manufacturing[100] and transportation[101] contexts.\nKevin Ashton, the digital innovation expert who is credited with coining the term,[102] defines the Internet of things in this quote: \"If we had computers that knew everything there was to know about things—using data they gathered without any help from us—we would be able to track and count everything, and greatly reduce waste, loss, and cost. We would know when things needed replacing, repairing, or recalling, and whether they were fresh or past their best.\"\n\nInformation technology[edit]\nEspecially since 2015, big data has come to prominence within business operations as a tool to help employees work more efficiently and streamline the collection and distribution of information technology (IT). The use of big data to resolve IT and data collection issues within an enterprise is called IT operations analytics (ITOA).[103] By applying big data principles into the concepts of machine intelligence and deep computing, IT departments can predict potential issues and prevent them.[103] ITOA businesses offer platforms for systems management that bring data silos together and generate insights from the whole of the system rather than from isolated pockets of data.\n\n\nCompared to survey-based data collection, big data has low cost per data point, applies analysis techniques via machine learning and data mining, and includes diverse and new data sources, e.g., registers, social media, apps, and other forms digital data. Since 2018, survey scientists have started to examine how big data and survey science can complement each other to allow researchers and practitioners to improve the production of statistics and its quality. There have been three Big Data Meets Survey Science (BigSurv) conferences in 2018, 2020 (virtual), 2023, and as of 2023 one conference forthcoming in 2025,[104] a special issue in the Social Science Computer Review,[105] a special issue in Journal of the Royal Statistical Society,[106] and a special issue in EP J Data Science,[107] and a book called Big Data Meets Social Sciences[108] edited by Craig Hill and five other Fellows of the American Statistical Association. In 2021, the founding members of BigSurv received the Warren J. Mitofsky Innovators Award from the American Association for Public Opinion Research.[109]\n\n\nBig data is notable in marketing due to the constant \"datafication\"[110] of everyday consumers of the internet, in which all forms of data are tracked. The datafication of consumers can be defined as  quantifying many of or all human behaviors for the purpose of marketing.[110] The increasingly digital world of rapid datafication makes this idea relevant to marketing because the amount of data constantly grows exponentially. It is predicted to increase from 44 to 163 zettabytes within the span of five years.[111] The size of big data can often be difficult to navigate for marketers.[112] As a result, adopters of big data may find themselves at a disadvantage. Algorithmic findings can be difficult to achieve with such large datasets.[113] Big data in marketing is a highly lucrative tool that can be used for large corporations, its value being as a result of the possibility of predicting significant trends, interests, or statistical outcomes in a consumer-based manner.[114]\nThere are three significant factors in the use of big data in marketing:\n\nBig data provides customer behavior pattern spotting for marketers, since all human actions are being quantified into readable numbers for marketers to analyze and use for their research.[115] In addition, big data can also be seen as a customized product recommendation tool. Specifically, since big data is effective in analyzing customers' purchase behaviors and browsing patterns, this technology can assist companies in promoting specific personalized products to specific customers.[116]\nReal-time market responsiveness is important for marketers because of the ability to shift marketing efforts and correct to current trends, which is helpful in maintaining relevance to consumers. This can supply corporations with the information necessary to predict the wants and needs of consumers in advance.[115]\nData-driven market ambidexterity are being highly fueled by big data.[115] New models and algorithms are being developed to make significant predictions about certain economic and social situations.[117]\n\n\n\nThe Integrated Joint Operations Platform (IJOP, 一体化联合作战平台) is used by the government to monitor the population, particularly Uyghurs.[118] Biometrics, including DNA samples, are gathered through a program of free physicals.[119]\nBy 2020, China plans to give all its citizens a personal \"social credit\" score based on how they behave.[120] The Social Credit System, now being piloted in a number of Chinese cities, is considered a form of mass surveillance which uses big data analysis technology.[121][122]\n\nBig data analysis was tried out for the BJP to win the 2014 Indian General Election.[123]\nThe Indian government uses numerous techniques to ascertain how the Indian electorate is responding to government action, as well as ideas for policy augmentation.\n\nPersonalized diabetic treatments can be created through GlucoMe's big data solution.[124]\n\nExamples of uses of big data in public services:\n\nData on prescription drugs: by connecting origin, location and the time of each prescription, a research unit was able to exemplify and examine the considerable delay between the release of any given drug, and a UK-wide adaptation of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines. This suggests that new or most up-to-date drugs take some time to filter through to the general patient.[citation needed][125]\nJoining up data: a local authority blended data about services, such as road gritting rotas, with services for people at risk, such as Meals on Wheels. The connection of data allowed the local authority to avoid any weather-related delay.[126]\n\nIn 2012, the Obama administration announced the Big Data Research and Development Initiative, to explore how big data could be used to address important problems faced by the government.[127] The initiative is composed of 84 different big data programs spread across six departments.[128]\nBig data analysis played a large role in Barack Obama's successful 2012 re-election campaign.[129]\nThe United States Federal Government owns four of the ten most powerful supercomputers in the world.[130][131]\nThe Utah Data Center has been constructed by the United States National Security Agency. When finished, the facility will be able to handle a large amount of information collected by the NSA over the Internet. The exact amount of storage space is unknown, but more recent sources claim it will be on the order of a few exabytes.[132][133][134] This has posed security concerns regarding the anonymity of the data collected.[135]\n\nWalmart handles more than 1 million customer transactions every hour, which are imported into databases estimated to contain more than 2.5 petabytes (2560 terabytes) of data—the equivalent of 167 times the information contained in all the books in the US Library of Congress.[6]\nWindermere Real Estate uses location information from nearly 100 million drivers to help new home buyers determine their typical drive times to and from work throughout various times of the day.[136]\nFICO Card Detection System protects accounts worldwide.[137]\nOmnichannel retailing[138] leverages online big data to improve offline experiences.\n\nThe Large Hadron Collider experiments represent about 150 million sensors delivering data 40 million times per second. There are nearly 600 million collisions per second. After filtering and refraining from recording more than 99.99995%[139] of these streams, there are 1,000 collisions of interest per second.[140][141][142]\nAs a result, only working with less than 0.001% of the sensor stream data, the data flow from all four LHC experiments represents 25 petabytes annual rate before replication (as of 2012). This becomes nearly 200 petabytes after replication.\nIf all sensor data were recorded in LHC, the data flow would be extremely hard to work with. The data flow would exceed 150 million petabytes annual rate, or nearly 500 exabytes per day, before replication. To put the number in perspective, this is equivalent to 500 quintillion (5×1020) bytes per day, almost 200 times more than all the other sources combined in the world.\nThe Square Kilometre Array is a radio telescope built of thousands of antennas. It is expected to be operational by 2024. Collectively, these antennas are expected to gather 14 exabytes and store one petabyte per day.[143][144] It is considered one of the most ambitious scientific projects ever undertaken.[145]\nWhen the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) began to collect astronomical data in 2000, it amassed more in its first few weeks than all data collected in the history of astronomy previously. Continuing at a rate of about 200 GB per night, SDSS has amassed more than 140 terabytes of information.[6] When the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, successor to SDSS, comes online in 2020, its designers expect it to acquire that amount of data every five days.[6]\nDecoding the human genome originally took 10 years to process; now it can be achieved in less than a day. The DNA sequencers have divided the sequencing cost by 10,000 in the last ten years, which is 100 times less expensive than the reduction in cost predicted by Moore's law.[146]\nThe NASA Center for Climate Simulation (NCCS) stores 32 petabytes of climate observations and simulations on the Discover supercomputing cluster.[147][148]\nGoogle's DNAStack compiles and organizes DNA samples of genetic data from around the world to identify diseases and other medical defects. These fast and exact calculations eliminate any \"friction points\", or human errors that could be made by one of the numerous science and biology experts working with the DNA. DNAStack, a part of Google Genomics, allows scientists to use the vast sample of resources from Google's search server to scale social experiments that would usually take years, instantly.[149][150]\n23andme's DNA database contains the genetic information of over 1,000,000 people worldwide.[151] The company explores selling the \"anonymous aggregated genetic data\" to other researchers and pharmaceutical companies for research purposes if patients give their consent.[152][153][154][155][156] Ahmad Hariri, professor of psychology and neuroscience at Duke University who has been using 23andMe in his research since 2009 states that the most important aspect of the company's new service is that it makes genetic research accessible and relatively cheap for scientists.[152] A study that identified 15 genome sites linked to depression in 23andMe's database lead to a surge in demands to access the repository with 23andMe fielding nearly 20 requests to access the depression data in the two weeks after publication of the paper.[157]\nComputational fluid dynamics (CFD) and hydrodynamic turbulence research generate massive data sets. The Johns Hopkins Turbulence Databases (JHTDB) contains over 350 terabytes of spatiotemporal fields from Direct Numerical simulations of various turbulent flows. Such data have been difficult to share using traditional methods such as downloading flat simulation output files. The data within JHTDB can be accessed using \"virtual sensors\" with various access modes ranging from direct web-browser queries, access through Matlab, Python, Fortran and C programs executing on clients' platforms, to cut out services to download raw data. The data have been used in over 150 scientific publications.\n\nBig data can be used to improve training and understanding competitors, using sport sensors. It is also possible to predict winners in a match using big data analytics.[158]\nFuture performance of players could be predicted as well.[159] Thus, players' value and salary is determined by data collected throughout the season.[160]\nIn Formula One races, race cars with hundreds of sensors generate terabytes of data. These sensors collect data points from tire pressure to fuel burn efficiency.[161]\nBased on the data, engineers and data analysts decide whether adjustments should be made in order to win a race. Besides, using big data, race teams try to predict the time they will finish the race beforehand, based on simulations using data collected over the season.[162]\n\n\nAs of 2013, eBay.com uses two data warehouses at 7.5 petabytes and 40PB as well as a 40PB Hadoop cluster for search, consumer recommendations, and merchandising.[163]\nAmazon.com handles millions of back-end operations every day, as well as queries from more than half a million third-party sellers. The core technology that keeps Amazon running is Linux-based and as of 2005 they had the world's three largest Linux databases, with capacities of 7.8 TB, 18.5 TB, and 24.7 TB.[164]\nFacebook handles 50 billion photos from its user base.[165] As of June 2017, Facebook reached 2 billion monthly active users.[166]\nGoogle was handling roughly 100 billion searches per month as of August 2012.[167]\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, big data was raised as a way to minimise the impact of the disease. Significant applications of big data included minimising the spread of the virus, case identification and development of medical treatment.[168]\nGovernments used big data to track infected people to minimise spread. Early adopters included China, Taiwan, South Korea, and Israel.[169][170][171]\n\nResearch activities[edit]\nEncrypted search and cluster formation in big data were demonstrated in March 2014 at the American Society of Engineering Education. Gautam Siwach engaged at Tackling the challenges of Big Data by MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and Amir Esmailpour at the UNH Research Group investigated the key features of big data as the formation of clusters and their interconnections. They focused on the security of big data and the orientation of the term towards the presence of different types of data in an encrypted form at cloud interface by providing the raw definitions and real-time examples within the technology. Moreover, they proposed an approach for identifying the encoding technique to advance towards an expedited search over encrypted text leading to the security enhancements in big data.[172]\nIn March 2012, The White House announced a national \"Big Data Initiative\" that consisted of six federal departments and agencies committing more than $200 million to big data research projects.[173]\nThe initiative included a National Science Foundation \"Expeditions in Computing\" grant of $10 million over five years to the AMPLab[174] at the University of California, Berkeley.[175] The AMPLab also received funds from DARPA, and over a dozen industrial sponsors and uses big data to attack a wide range of problems from predicting traffic congestion[176] to fighting cancer.[177]\nThe White House Big Data Initiative also included a commitment by the Department of Energy to provide $25 million in funding over five years to establish the Scalable Data Management, Analysis and Visualization (SDAV) Institute,[178] led by the Energy Department's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The SDAV Institute aims to bring together the expertise of six national laboratories and seven universities to develop new tools to help scientists manage and visualize data on the department's supercomputers.\nThe U.S. state of Massachusetts announced the Massachusetts Big Data Initiative in May 2012, which provides funding from the state government and private companies to a variety of research institutions.[179] The Massachusetts Institute of Technology hosts the Intel Science and Technology Center for Big Data in the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, combining government, corporate, and institutional funding and research efforts.[180]\nThe European Commission is funding the two-year-long Big Data Public Private Forum through their Seventh Framework Program to engage companies, academics and other stakeholders in discussing big data issues. The project aims to define a strategy in terms of research and innovation to guide supporting actions from the European Commission in the successful implementation of the big data economy. Outcomes of this project will be used as input for Horizon 2020, their next framework program.[181]\nThe British government announced in March 2014 the founding of the Alan Turing Institute, named after the computer pioneer and code-breaker, which will focus on new ways to collect and analyze large data sets.[182]\nAt the University of Waterloo Stratford Campus Canadian Open Data Experience (CODE) Inspiration Day, participants demonstrated how using data visualization can increase the understanding and appeal of big data sets and communicate their story to the world.[183]\nComputational social sciences – Anyone can use application programming interfaces (APIs) provided by big data holders, such as Google and Twitter, to do research in the social and behavioral sciences.[184] Often these APIs are provided for free.[184] Tobias Preis et al. used Google Trends data to demonstrate that Internet users from countries with a higher per capita gross domestic products (GDPs) are more likely to search for information about the future than information about the past. The findings suggest there may be a link between online behaviors and real-world economic indicators.[185][186][187] The authors of the study examined Google queries logs made by ratio of the volume of searches for the coming year (2011) to the volume of searches for the previous year (2009), which they call the \"future orientation index\".[188] They compared the future orientation index to the per capita GDP of each country, and found a strong tendency for countries where Google users inquire more about the future to have a higher GDP.\nTobias Preis and his colleagues Helen Susannah Moat and H. Eugene Stanley introduced a method to identify online precursors for stock market moves, using trading strategies based on search volume data provided by Google Trends.[189] Their analysis of Google search volume for 98 terms of varying financial relevance, published in Scientific Reports,[190] suggests that increases in search volume for financially relevant search terms tend to precede large losses in financial markets.[191][192][193][194][195][196][197]\nBig data sets come with algorithmic challenges that previously did not exist. Hence, there is seen by some to be a need to fundamentally change the processing ways.[198]\n\n\nA research question that is asked about big data sets is whether it is necessary to look at the full data to draw certain conclusions about the properties of the data or if is a sample is good enough. The name big data itself contains a term related to size and this is an important characteristic of big data. But sampling enables the selection of right data points from within the larger data set to estimate the characteristics of the whole population. In manufacturing different types of sensory data such as acoustics, vibration, pressure, current, voltage, and controller data are available at short time intervals. To predict downtime it may not be necessary to look at all the data but a sample may be sufficient. Big data can be broken down by various data point categories such as demographic, psychographic, behavioral, and transactional data. With large sets of data points, marketers are able to create and use more customized segments of consumers for more strategic targeting.\n\n\nCritiques of the big data paradigm come in two flavors: those that question the implications of the approach itself, and those that question the way it is currently done.[199] One approach to this criticism is the field of critical data studies.\n\nCritiques of the big data paradigm[edit]\n\"A crucial problem is that we do not know much about the underlying empirical micro-processes that lead to the emergence of the[se] typical network characteristics of Big Data.\"[23][page needed]  In their critique, Snijders, Matzat, and Reips point out that often very strong assumptions are made about mathematical properties that may not at all reflect what is really going on at the level of micro-processes. Mark Graham has leveled broad critiques at Chris Anderson's assertion that big data will spell the end of theory:[200] focusing in particular on the notion that big data must always be contextualized in their social, economic, and political contexts.[201] Even as companies invest eight- and nine-figure sums to derive insight from information streaming in from suppliers and customers, less than 40% of employees have sufficiently mature processes and skills to do so. To overcome this insight deficit, big data, no matter how comprehensive or well analyzed, must be complemented by \"big judgment\", according to an article in the Harvard Business Review.[202]\nMuch in the same line, it has been pointed out that the decisions based on the analysis of big data are inevitably \"informed by the world as it was in the past, or, at best, as it currently is\".[65][page needed] Fed by a large number of data on past experiences, algorithms can predict future development if the future is similar to the past.[203] If the system's dynamics of the future change (if it is not a stationary process), the past can say little about the future. In order to make predictions in changing environments, it would be necessary to have a thorough understanding of the systems dynamic, which requires theory.[203] As a response to this critique Alemany Oliver and Vayre suggest to use \"abductive reasoning as a first step in the research process in order to bring context to consumers' digital traces and make new theories emerge\".[204]  Additionally, it has been suggested to combine big data approaches with computer simulations, such as agent-based models[65][page needed] and complex systems. Agent-based models are increasingly getting better in predicting the outcome of social complexities of even unknown future scenarios through computer simulations that are based on a collection of mutually interdependent algorithms.[205][206] Finally, the use of multivariate methods that probe for the latent structure of the data, such as factor analysis and cluster analysis, have proven useful as analytic approaches that go well beyond the bi-variate approaches (e.g. contingency tables) typically employed with smaller data sets.\nIn health and biology, conventional scientific approaches are based on experimentation. For these approaches, the limiting factor is the relevant data that can confirm or refute the initial hypothesis.[207]  A new postulate is accepted now in biosciences: the information provided by the data in huge volumes (omics) without prior hypothesis is complementary and sometimes necessary to conventional approaches based on experimentation.[208][209] In the massive approaches it is the formulation of a relevant hypothesis to explain the data that is the limiting factor.[210] The search logic is reversed and the limits of induction (\"Glory of Science and Philosophy scandal\", C. D. Broad, 1926) are to be considered.[citation needed]\nPrivacy advocates are concerned about the threat to privacy represented by increasing storage and integration of personally identifiable information; expert panels have released various policy recommendations to conform practice to expectations of privacy.[211] The misuse of big data in several cases by media, companies, and even the government has allowed for abolition of trust in almost every fundamental institution holding up society.[212]\nBarocas and Nissenbaum argue that one way of protecting individual users is by being informed about the types of information being collected, with whom it is shared, under what constraints and for what purposes.[213]\n\nCritiques of the \"V\" model[edit]\nThe \"V\" model of big data is concerning as it centers around computational scalability and lacks in a loss around the perceptibility and understandability of information. This led to the framework of cognitive big data, which characterizes big data applications according to:[214]\n\nData completeness: understanding of the non-obvious from data\nData correlation, causation, and predictability: causality as not essential requirement to achieve predictability\nExplainability and interpretability: humans desire to understand and accept what they understand, where algorithms do not cope with this\nLevel of automated decision-making: algorithms that support automated decision making and algorithmic self-learning\nCritiques of novelty[edit]\nLarge data sets have been analyzed by computing machines for well over a century, including the US census analytics performed by IBM's punch-card machines which computed statistics including means and variances of populations across the whole continent. In more recent decades, science experiments such as CERN have produced data on similar scales to current commercial \"big data\". However, science experiments have tended to analyze their data using specialized custom-built high-performance computing (super-computing) clusters and grids, rather than clouds of cheap commodity computers as in the current commercial wave, implying a difference in both culture and technology stack.\n\nCritiques of big data execution[edit]\nUlf-Dietrich Reips and Uwe Matzat wrote in 2014 that big data had become a \"fad\" in scientific research.[184] Researcher danah boyd has raised concerns about the use of big data in science neglecting principles such as choosing a representative sample by being too concerned about handling the huge amounts of data.[215] This approach may lead to results that have a bias in one way or another.[216] Integration across heterogeneous data resources—some that might be considered big data and others not—presents formidable logistical as well as analytical challenges, but many researchers argue that such integrations are likely to represent the most promising new frontiers in science.[217]\nIn the provocative article \"Critical Questions for Big Data\",[218] the authors title big data a part of mythology: \"large data sets offer a higher form of intelligence and knowledge [...], with the aura of truth, objectivity, and accuracy\". Users of big data are often \"lost in the sheer volume of numbers\", and \"working with Big Data is still subjective, and what it quantifies does not necessarily have a closer claim on objective truth\".[218] Recent developments in BI domain, such as pro-active reporting especially target improvements in the usability of big data, through automated filtering of non-useful data and correlations.[219] Big structures are full of spurious correlations[220] either because of non-causal coincidences (law of truly large numbers), solely nature of big randomness[221] (Ramsey theory), or existence of non-included factors so the hope, of early experimenters to make large databases of numbers \"speak for themselves\" and revolutionize scientific method, is questioned.[222] Catherine Tucker has pointed to \"hype\" around big data, writing \"By itself, big data is unlikely to be valuable.\" The article explains: \"The many contexts where data is cheap relative to the cost of retaining talent to process it, suggests that processing skills are more important than data itself in creating value for a firm.\"[223]\nBig data analysis is often shallow compared to analysis of smaller data sets.[224] In many big data projects, there is no large data analysis happening, but the challenge is the extract, transform, load part of data pre-processing.[224]\nBig data is a buzzword and a \"vague term\",[225][226] but at the same time an \"obsession\"[226] with entrepreneurs, consultants, scientists, and the media. Big data showcases such as Google Flu Trends failed to deliver good predictions in recent years, overstating the flu outbreaks by a factor of two. Similarly, Academy Awards and election predictions solely based on Twitter were more often off than on target.\nBig data often poses the same challenges as small data; adding more data does not solve problems of bias, but may emphasize other problems. In particular data sources such as Twitter are not representative of the overall population, and results drawn from such sources may then lead to wrong conclusions. Google Translate—which is based on big data statistical analysis of text—does a good job at translating web pages. However, results from specialized domains may be dramatically skewed.\nOn the other hand, big data may also introduce new problems, such as the multiple comparisons problem: simultaneously testing a large set of hypotheses is likely to produce many false results that mistakenly appear significant.\nIoannidis argued that \"most published research findings are false\"[227] due to essentially the same effect: when many scientific teams and researchers each perform many experiments (i.e. process a big amount of scientific data; although not with big data technology), the likelihood of a \"significant\" result being false grows fast – even more so, when only positive results are published.\nFurthermore, big data analytics results are only as good as the model on which they are predicated. In an example, big data took part in attempting to predict the results of the 2016 U.S. presidential election[228] with varying degrees of success.\n\nCritiques of big data policing and surveillance[edit]\nBig data has been used in policing and surveillance by institutions like law enforcement and corporations (see: corporate surveillance and surveillance capitalism).[229] Due to the less visible nature of data-based surveillance as compared to traditional methods of policing, objections to big data policing are less likely to arise. According to Sarah Brayne's Big Data Surveillance: The Case of Policing,[230] big data policing can reproduce existing societal inequalities in three ways:\n\nPlacing people under increased surveillance by using the justification of a mathematical and therefore unbiased algorithm\nIncreasing the scope and number of people that are subject to law enforcement tracking and exacerbating existing racial overrepresentation in the criminal justice system\nEncouraging members of society to abandon interactions with institutions that would create a digital trace, thus creating obstacles to social inclusion\nIf these potential problems are not corrected or regulated, the effects of big data policing may continue to shape societal hierarchies. Conscientious usage of big data policing could prevent individual level biases from becoming institutional biases, Brayne also notes.\n\n\n\n\nBig data ethics – Ethics of mass data analytics\nBig data maturity model – Aspect of computer science\nBig memory – Large amount of random-access memory\nData curation – Organization of collected data\nData defined storage – Marketing term for managing data by combining application, information and storage tiers\nData engineering – Software engineering approach to designing and developing information systems\nData lineage – Origins and events of data\nData philanthropy – Aspect of culture\nData science – Field of study to extract knowledge from data\nDatafication – Technological trend\nDocument-oriented database – Type of computer program\nList of big data companies\nVery large database – Database that contains a very large amount of data\nTopological data analysis – Analysis of datasets using techniques from topology\nXLDB\nDARWIN EU – Initiative to improve evaluation and supervision of medicines\n\n\n^ Breur, Tom (July 2016). \"Statistical Power Analysis and the contemporary \"crisis\" in social sciences\".

    "content": "Large supercomputers such as IBM's Blue Gene/P are designed to heavily exploit parallelism. \nParallel computing is a type of computation in which many calculations or processes are carried out simultaneously.[1] Large problems can often be divided into smaller ones, which can then be solved at the same time. There are several different forms of parallel computing: bit-level, instruction-level, data, and task parallelism. Parallelism has long been employed in high-performance computing, but has gained broader interest due to the physical constraints preventing frequency scaling.[2] As power consumption (and consequently heat generation) by computers has become a concern in recent years,[3] parallel computing has become the dominant paradigm in computer architecture, mainly in the form of multi-core processors.[4]\n\nParallelism vs concurrency\nIn computer science, parallelism and concurrency are two different things: a parallel program uses multiple CPU cores, each core performing a task independently. On the other hand, concurrency enables a program to deal with multiple tasks even on a single CPU core; the core switches between tasks (i.e. threads) without necessarily completing each one. A program can have both, neither or a combination of parallelism and concurrency characteristics.[5]\nParallel computers can be roughly classified according to the level at which the hardware supports parallelism, with multi-core and multi-processor computers having multiple processing elements within a single machine, while clusters, MPPs, and grids use multiple computers to work on the same task. Specialized parallel computer architectures are sometimes used alongside traditional processors, for accelerating specific tasks.\nIn some cases parallelism is transparent to the programmer, such as in bit-level or instruction-level parallelism, but explicitly parallel algorithms, particularly those that use concurrency, are more difficult to write than sequential ones,[6] because concurrency introduces several new classes of potential software bugs, of which race conditions are the most common. Communication and synchronization between the different subtasks are typically some of the greatest obstacles to getting optimal parallel program performance.\nA theoretical upper bound on the speed-up of a single program as a result of parallelization is given by Amdahl's law, which states that it is limited by the fraction of time for which the parallelization can be utilised.\n\n\n\nTraditionally, computer software has been written for serial computation. To solve a problem, an algorithm is constructed and implemented as a serial stream of instructions. These instructions are executed on a central processing unit on one computer. Only one instruction may execute at a time—after that instruction is finished, the next one is executed.[7]\nParallel computing, on the other hand, uses multiple processing elements simultaneously to solve a problem. This is accomplished by breaking the problem into independent parts so that each processing element can execute its part of the algorithm simultaneously with the others. The processing elements can be diverse and include resources such as a single computer with multiple processors, several networked computers, specialized hardware, or any combination of the above.[7] Historically parallel computing was used for scientific computing and the simulation of scientific problems, particularly in the natural and engineering sciences, such as meteorology. This led to the design of parallel hardware and software, as well as high performance computing.[8]\nFrequency scaling was the dominant reason for improvements in computer performance from the mid-1980s until 2004. The runtime of a program is equal to the number of instructions multiplied by the average time per instruction. Maintaining everything else constant, increasing the clock frequency decreases the average time it takes to execute an instruction. An increase in frequency thus decreases runtime for all compute-bound programs.[9] However, power consumption P by a chip is given by the equation P = C × V 2 × F, where C is the capacitance being switched per clock cycle (proportional to the number of transistors whose inputs change), V is voltage, and F is the processor frequency (cycles per second).[10] Increases in frequency increase the amount of power used in a processor. Increasing processor power consumption led ultimately to Intel's May 8, 2004 cancellation of its Tejas and Jayhawk processors, which is generally cited as the end of frequency scaling as the dominant computer architecture paradigm.[11]\nTo deal with the problem of power consumption and overheating the major central processing unit (CPU or processor) manufacturers started to produce power efficient processors with multiple cores. The core is the computing unit of the processor and in multi-core processors each core is independent and can access the same memory concurrently. Multi-core processors have brought parallel computing to desktop computers. Thus parallelization of serial programs has become a mainstream programming task. In 2012 quad-core processors became standard for desktop computers, while servers had 10+ core processors. Moore's law predicted that the number of cores per processor would double every 18–24 months.[12] By 2023 some processors had over hundred cores. Some designs having a mix of performance and efficiency cores (such as ARM's big.LITTLE design) due to thermal and design constraints.[citation needed] \nAn operating system can ensure that different tasks and user programs are run in parallel on the available cores. However, for a serial software program to take full advantage of the multi-core architecture the programmer needs to restructure and parallelize the code. A speed-up of application software runtime will no longer be achieved through frequency scaling, instead programmers will need to parallelize their software code to take advantage of the increasing computing power of multicore architectures.[13]\n\n\nA graphical representation of Amdahl's law. The law demonstrates the theoretical maximum speedup of an overall system and the concept of diminishing returns. If exactly 50% of the work can be parallelized, the best possible speedup is 2 times. If 95% of the work can be parallelized, the best possible speedup is 20 times. According to the law, even with an infinite number of processors, the speedup is constrained by the unparallelizable portion.\nAssume that a task has two independent parts, A and B. Part B takes roughly 25% of the time of the whole computation. By working very hard, one may be able to make this part 5 times faster, but this only reduces the time for the whole computation by a little. In contrast, one may need to perform less work to make part A twice as fast. This will make the computation much faster than by optimizing part B, even though part B's speedup is greater by ratio, (5 times versus 2 times).\nOptimally, the speedup from parallelization would be linear—doubling the number of processing elements should halve the runtime, and doubling it a second time should again halve the runtime. However, very few parallel algorithms achieve optimal speedup. Most of them have a near-linear speedup for small numbers of processing elements, which flattens out into a constant value for large numbers of processing elements.\nThe maximum potential speedup of an overall system can be calculated by Amdahl's law.[14] Amdahl's Law indicates that optimal performance improvement is achieved by balancing enhancements to both parallelizable and non-parallelizable components of a task. Furthermore, it reveals that increasing the number of processors yields diminishing returns, with negligible speedup gains beyond a certain point.[15][16]\nAmdahl's Law has limitations, including assumptions of fixed workload, neglecting inter-process communication and synchronization overheads, primarily focusing on computational aspect and ignoring extrinsic factors such as data persistence, I/O operations, and memory access overheads.[17][18][19]\n\nGustafson's law and Universal Scalability Law give a more realistic assessment of the parallel performance.[20][21]A graphical representation of Gustafson's law\n\nUnderstanding data dependencies is fundamental in implementing parallel algorithms. No program can run more quickly than the longest chain of dependent calculations (known as the critical path), since calculations that depend upon prior calculations in the chain must be executed in order. However, most algorithms do not consist of just a long chain of dependent calculations; there are usually opportunities to execute independent calculations in parallel.\nLet Pi and Pj be two program segments. Bernstein's conditions[22] describe when the two are independent and can be executed in parallel. For Pi, let Ii be all of the input variables and Oi the output variables, and likewise for Pj. Pi and Pj are independent if they satisfy\n\n\n\n\nViolation of the first condition introduces a flow dependency, corresponding to the first segment producing a result used by the second segment. The second condition represents an anti-dependency, when the second segment produces a variable needed by the first segment. The third and final condition represents an output dependency: when two segments write to the same location, the result comes from the logically last executed segment.[23]\nConsider the following functions, which demonstrate several kinds of dependencies:\n\n1: function Dep(a, b)\n2: c := a * b\n3: d := 3 * c\n4: end function\n\nIn this example, instruction 3 cannot be executed before (or even in parallel with) instruction 2, because instruction 3 uses a result from instruction 2. It violates condition 1, and thus introduces a flow dependency.\n\n1: function NoDep(a, b)\n2: c := a * b\n3: d := 3 * b\n4: e := a + b\n5: end function\n\nIn this example, there are no dependencies between the instructions, so they can all be run in parallel.\nBernstein's conditions do not allow memory to be shared between different processes. For that, some means of enforcing an ordering between accesses is necessary, such as semaphores, barriers or some other synchronization method.\n\nRace conditions, mutual exclusion, synchronization, and parallel slowdown[edit]\nSubtasks in a parallel program are often called threads. Some parallel computer architectures use smaller, lightweight versions of threads known as fibers, while others use bigger versions known as processes. However, \"threads\" is generally accepted as a generic term for subtasks.[24] Threads will often need synchronized access to an object or other resource, for example when they must update a variable that is shared between them. Without synchronization, the instructions between the two threads may be interleaved in any order. For example, consider the following program:\n\n\n\n\nThread A\n\nThread B\n\n\n1A: Read variable V\n\n1B: Read variable V\n\n\n2A: Add 1 to variable V\n\n2B: Add 1 to variable V\n\n\n3A: Write back to variable V\n\n3B: Write back to variable V\n\nIf instruction 1B is executed between 1A and 3A, or if instruction 1A is executed between 1B and 3B, the program will produce incorrect data. This is known as a race condition. The programmer must use a lock to provide mutual exclusion. A lock is a programming language construct that allows one thread to take control of a variable and prevent other threads from reading or writing it, until that variable is unlocked. The thread holding the lock is free to execute its critical section (the section of a program that requires exclusive access to some variable), and to unlock the data when it is finished. Therefore, to guarantee correct program execution, the above program can be rewritten to use locks:\n\n\n\n\nThread A\n\nThread B\n\n\n1A: Lock variable V\n\n1B: Lock variable V\n\n\n2A: Read variable V\n\n2B: Read variable V\n\n\n3A: Add 1 to variable V\n\n3B: Add 1 to variable V\n\n\n4A: Write back to variable V\n\n4B: Write back to variable V\n\n\n5A: Unlock variable V\n\n5B: Unlock variable V\n\nOne thread will successfully lock variable V, while the other thread will be locked out—unable to proceed until V is unlocked again. This guarantees correct execution of the program. Locks may be necessary to ensure correct program execution when threads must serialize access to resources, but their use can greatly slow a program and may affect its reliability.[25]\nLocking multiple variables using non-atomic locks introduces the possibility of program deadlock. An atomic lock locks multiple variables all at once. If it cannot lock all of them, it does not lock any of them. If two threads each need to lock the same two variables using non-atomic locks, it is possible that one thread will lock one of them and the second thread will lock the second variable. In such a case, neither thread can complete, and deadlock results.[26]\nMany parallel programs require that their subtasks act in synchrony. This requires the use of a barrier. Barriers are typically implemented using a lock or a semaphore.[27] One class of algorithms, known as lock-free and wait-free algorithms, altogether avoids the use of locks and barriers. However, this approach is generally difficult to implement and requires correctly designed data structures.[28]\nNot all parallelization results in speed-up. Generally, as a task is split up into more and more threads, those threads spend an ever-increasing portion of their time communicating with each other or waiting on each other for access to resources.[29][30] Once the overhead from resource contention or communication dominates the time spent on other computation, further parallelization (that is, splitting the workload over even more threads) increases rather than decreases the amount of time required to finish. This problem, known as parallel slowdown,[31] can be improved in some cases by software analysis and redesign.[32]\n\nFine-grained, coarse-grained, and embarrassing parallelism[edit]\nApplications are often classified according to how often their subtasks need to synchronize or communicate with each other. An application exhibits fine-grained parallelism if its subtasks must communicate many times per second; it exhibits coarse-grained parallelism if they do not communicate many times per second, and it exhibits embarrassing parallelism if they rarely or never have to communicate. Embarrassingly parallel applications are considered the easiest to parallelize.\n\n\n\nMichael J. Flynn created one of the earliest classification systems for parallel (and sequential) computers and programs, now known as Flynn's taxonomy. Flynn classified programs and computers by whether they were operating using a single set or multiple sets of instructions, and whether or not those instructions were using a single set or multiple sets of data.\n\n\nThe single-instruction-single-data (SISD) classification is equivalent to an entirely sequential program. The single-instruction-multiple-data (SIMD) classification is analogous to doing the same operation repeatedly over a large data set. This is commonly done in signal processing applications. Multiple-instruction-single-data (MISD) is a rarely used classification. While computer architectures to deal with this were devised (such as systolic arrays), few applications that fit this class materialized. Multiple-instruction-multiple-data (MIMD) programs are by far the most common type of parallel programs.\nAccording to David A. Patterson and John L. Hennessy, \"Some machines are hybrids of these categories, of course, but this classic model has survived because it is simple, easy to understand, and gives a good first approximation. It is also—perhaps because of its understandability—the most widely used scheme.\"[34]\n\n\nParallel computing can incur significant overhead in practice, primarily due to the costs associated with merging data from multiple processes. Specifically, inter-process communication and synchronization can lead to overheads that are substantially higher—often by two or more orders of magnitude—compared to processing the same data on a single thread.[35][36][37] Therefore, the overall improvement should be carefully evaluated.\n\n\nBit-level parallelism[edit]\n\nTaiwania 3 of Taiwan, a parallel supercomputing device that joined COVID-19 research\nFrom the advent of very-large-scale integration (VLSI) computer-chip fabrication technology in the 1970s until about 1986, speed-up in computer architecture was driven by doubling computer word size—the amount of information the processor can manipulate per cycle.[38] Increasing the word size reduces the number of instructions the processor must execute to perform an operation on variables whose sizes are greater than the length of the word. For example, where an 8-bit processor must add two 16-bit integers, the processor must first add the 8 lower-order bits from each integer using the standard addition instruction, then add the 8 higher-order bits using an add-with-carry instruction and the carry bit from the lower order addition; thus, an 8-bit processor requires two instructions to complete a single operation, where a 16-bit processor would be able to complete the operation with a single instruction.\nHistorically, 4-bit microprocessors were replaced with 8-bit, then 16-bit, then 32-bit microprocessors. This trend generally came to an end with the introduction of 32-bit processors, which has been a standard in general-purpose computing for two decades. Not until the early 2000s, with the advent of x86-64 architectures, did 64-bit processors become commonplace.\n\nInstruction-level parallelism[edit]\n\nA canonical processor without pipeline. It takes five clock cycles to complete one instruction and thus the processor can issue subscalar performance (IPC = 0.2 < 1).\nA computer program is, in essence, a stream of instructions executed by a processor. Without instruction-level parallelism, a processor can only issue less than one instruction per clock cycle (IPC < 1). These processors are known as subscalar processors. These instructions can be re-ordered and combined into groups which are then executed in parallel without changing the result of the program. This is known as instruction-level parallelism. Advances in instruction-level parallelism dominated computer architecture from the mid-1980s until the mid-1990s.[39]\n\nA canonical five-stage pipelined processor. In the best case scenario, it takes one clock cycle to complete one instruction and thus the processor can issue scalar performance (IPC = 1).\nAll modern processors have multi-stage instruction pipelines. Each stage in the pipeline corresponds to a different action the processor performs on that instruction in that stage; a processor with an N-stage pipeline can have up to N different instructions at different stages of completion and thus can issue one instruction per clock cycle (IPC = 1). These processors are known as scalar processors. The canonical example of a pipelined processor is a RISC processor, with five stages: instruction fetch (IF), instruction decode (ID), execute (EX), memory access (MEM), and register write back (WB). The Pentium 4 processor had a 35-stage pipeline.[40]\n\nA canonical five-stage pipelined processor with two execution units. In the best case scenario, it takes one clock cycle to complete two instructions and thus the processor can issue superscalar performance (IPC = 2 > 1).\nMost modern processors also have multiple execution units. They usually combine this feature with pipelining and thus can issue more than one instruction per clock cycle (IPC > 1). These processors are known as superscalar processors. Superscalar processors differ from multi-core processors in that the several execution units are not entire processors (i.e. processing units). Instructions can be grouped together only if there is no data dependency between them. Scoreboarding and the Tomasulo algorithm (which is similar to scoreboarding but makes use of register renaming) are two of the most common techniques for implementing out-of-order execution and instruction-level parallelism.\n\n\n\nTask parallelisms is the characteristic of a parallel program that \"entirely different calculations can be performed on either the same or different sets of data\".[41] This contrasts with data parallelism, where the same calculation is performed on the same or different sets of data. Task parallelism involves the decomposition of a task into sub-tasks and then allocating each sub-task to a processor for execution. The processors would then execute these sub-tasks concurrently and often cooperatively. Task parallelism does not usually scale with the size of a problem.[42]\n\nSuperword level parallelism[edit]\nSuperword level parallelism is a vectorization technique based on loop unrolling and basic block vectorization. It is distinct from loop vectorization algorithms in that it can exploit parallelism of inline code, such as manipulating coordinates, color channels or in loops unrolled by hand.[43]\n\n\nMemory and communication[edit]\nMain memory in a parallel computer is either shared memory (shared between all processing elements in a single address space), or distributed memory (in which each processing element has its own local address space).[44] Distributed memory refers to the fact that the memory is logically distributed, but often implies that it is physically distributed as well. Distributed shared memory and memory virtualization combine the two approaches, where the processing element has its own local memory and access to the memory on non-local processors. Accesses to local memory are typically faster than accesses to non-local memory. On the supercomputers, distributed shared memory space can be implemented using the programming model such as PGAS.  This model allows processes on one compute node to transparently access the remote memory of another compute node. All compute nodes are also connected to an external shared memory system via high-speed interconnect, such as Infiniband, this external shared memory system is known as burst buffer, which is typically built from arrays of non-volatile memory physically distributed across multiple I/O nodes.\n\nA logical view of a non-uniform memory access (NUMA) architecture. Processors in one directory can access that directory's memory with less latency than they can access memory in the other directory's memory.\nComputer architectures in which each element of main memory can be accessed with equal latency and bandwidth are known as uniform memory access (UMA) systems. Typically, that can be achieved only by a shared memory system, in which the memory is not physically distributed. A system that does not have this property is known as a non-uniform memory access (NUMA) architecture. Distributed memory systems have non-uniform memory access.\nComputer systems make use of caches—small and fast memories located close to the processor which store temporary copies of memory values (nearby in both the physical and logical sense). Parallel computer systems have difficulties with caches that may store the same value in more than one location, with the possibility of incorrect program execution. These computers require a cache coherency system, which keeps track of cached values and strategically purges them, thus ensuring correct program execution. Bus snooping is one of the most common methods for keeping track of which values are being accessed (and thus should be purged). Designing large, high-performance cache coherence systems is a very difficult problem in computer architecture. As a result, shared memory computer architectures do not scale as well as distributed memory systems do.[44]\nProcessor–processor and processor–memory communication can be implemented in hardware in several ways, including via shared (either multiported or multiplexed) memory, a crossbar switch, a shared bus or an interconnect network of a myriad of topologies including star, ring, tree, hypercube, fat hypercube (a hypercube with more than one processor at a node), or n-dimensional mesh.\nParallel computers based on interconnected networks need to have some kind of routing to enable the passing of messages between nodes that are not directly connected. The medium used for communication between the processors is likely to be hierarchical in large multiprocessor machines.\n\nClasses of parallel computers[edit]\nParallel computers can be roughly classified according to the level at which the hardware supports parallelism. This classification is broadly analogous to the distance between basic computing nodes. These are not mutually exclusive; for example, clusters of symmetric multiprocessors are relatively common.\n\nMulti-core computing[edit]\n\nA multi-core processor is a processor that includes multiple processing units (called \"cores\") on the same chip. This processor differs from a superscalar processor, which includes multiple execution units and can issue multiple instructions per clock cycle from one instruction stream (thread); in contrast, a multi-core processor can issue multiple instructions per clock cycle from multiple instruction streams. IBM's Cell microprocessor, designed for use in the Sony PlayStation 3, is a prominent multi-core processor. Each core in a multi-core processor can potentially be superscalar as well—that is, on every clock cycle, each core can issue multiple instructions from one thread.\nSimultaneous multithreading  (of which Intel's Hyper-Threading is the best known) was an early form of pseudo-multi-coreism. A processor capable of concurrent multithreading includes multiple execution units in the same processing unit—that is it has a superscalar architecture—and can issue multiple instructions per clock cycle from multiple threads. Temporal multithreading on the other hand includes a single execution unit in the same processing unit and can issue one instruction at a time from multiple threads.\n\nSymmetric multiprocessing[edit]\n\nA symmetric multiprocessor (SMP) is a computer system with multiple identical processors that share memory and connect via a bus.[45] Bus contention prevents bus architectures from scaling. As a result, SMPs generally do not comprise more than 32 processors.[46] Because of the small size of the processors and the significant reduction in the requirements for bus bandwidth achieved by large caches, such symmetric multiprocessors are extremely cost-effective, provided that a sufficient amount of memory bandwidth exists.[45]\n\nDistributed computing[edit]\n\nA distributed computer (also known as a distributed memory multiprocessor) is a distributed memory computer system in which the processing elements are connected by a network. Distributed computers are highly scalable. The terms \"concurrent computing\", \"parallel computing\", and \"distributed computing\" have a lot of overlap, and no clear distinction exists between them.[47][48] The same system may be characterized both as \"parallel\" and \"distributed\"; the processors in a typical distributed system run concurrently in parallel.[49][50]\n\n\n\nA Beowulf cluster\nA cluster is a group of loosely coupled computers that work together closely, so that in some respects they can be regarded as a single computer.[51] Clusters are composed of multiple standalone machines connected by a network. While machines in a cluster do not have to be symmetric, load balancing is more difficult if they are not. The most common type of cluster is the Beowulf cluster, which is a cluster implemented on multiple identical commercial off-the-shelf computers connected with a TCP/IP Ethernet local area network.[52] Beowulf technology was originally developed by Thomas Sterling and Donald Becker. 87% of all Top500 supercomputers are clusters.[53] The remaining are Massively Parallel Processors, explained below.\nBecause grid computing systems (described below) can easily handle embarrassingly parallel problems, modern clusters are typically designed to handle more difficult problems—problems that require nodes to share intermediate results with each other more often. This requires a high bandwidth and, more importantly, a low-latency interconnection network. Many historic and current supercomputers use customized high-performance network hardware specifically designed for cluster computing, such as the Cray Gemini network.[54] As of 2014, most current supercomputers use some off-the-shelf standard network hardware, often Myrinet, InfiniBand, or Gigabit Ethernet.\n\nMassively parallel computing[edit]\n\nA cabinet from IBM's Blue Gene/L massively parallel supercomputer\nA massively parallel processor (MPP) is a single computer with many networked processors. MPPs have many of the same characteristics as clusters, but MPPs have specialized interconnect networks (whereas clusters use commodity hardware for networking). MPPs also tend to be larger than clusters, typically having \"far more\" than 100 processors.[55] In an MPP, \"each CPU contains its own memory and copy of the operating system and application. Each subsystem communicates with the others via a high-speed interconnect.\"[56]\nIBM's Blue Gene/L, the fifth fastest supercomputer in the world according to the June 2009 TOP500 ranking, is an MPP.\n\n\n\nGrid computing is the most distributed form of parallel computing. It makes use of computers communicating over the Internet to work on a given problem. Because of the low bandwidth and extremely high latency available on the Internet, distributed computing typically deals only with embarrassingly parallel problems.\nMost grid computing applications use middleware (software that sits between the operating system and the application to manage network resources and standardize the software interface). The most common grid computing middleware is the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC). Often volunteer computing software makes use of \"spare cycles\", performing computations at times when a computer is idling.[57]\n\n\n\nThe ubiquity of Internet brought the possibility of large-scale cloud computing.\n\nSpecialized parallel computers[edit]\nWithin parallel computing, there are specialized parallel devices that remain niche areas of interest. While not domain-specific, they tend to be applicable to only a few classes of parallel problems.\n\nReconfigurable computing with field-programmable gate arrays[edit]\nReconfigurable computing is the use of a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) as a co-processor to a general-purpose computer. An FPGA is, in essence, a computer chip that can rewire itself for a given task.\nFPGAs can be programmed with hardware description languages such as VHDL[58] or Verilog.[59] Several vendors have created C to HDL languages that attempt to emulate the syntax and semantics of the C programming language, with which most programmers are familiar. The best known C to HDL languages are Mitrion-C, Impulse C, and Handel-C. Specific subsets of SystemC based on C++ can also be used for this purpose.\nAMD's decision to open its HyperTransport technology to third-party vendors has become the enabling technology for high-performance reconfigurable computing.[60] According to Michael R. D'Amour, Chief Operating Officer of DRC Computer Corporation, \"when we first walked into AMD, they called us 'the socket stealers.' Now they call us their partners.\"[60]\n\nGeneral-purpose computing on graphics processing units (GPGPU)[edit]\n\nNvidia's Tesla GPGPU card\nGeneral-purpose computing on graphics processing units (GPGPU) is a fairly recent trend in computer engineering research. GPUs are co-processors that have been heavily optimized for computer graphics processing.[61] Computer graphics processing is a field dominated by data parallel operations—particularly linear algebra matrix operations.\nIn the early days, GPGPU programs used the normal graphics APIs for executing programs. However, several new programming languages and platforms have been built to do general purpose computation on GPUs with both Nvidia and AMD releasing programming environments with CUDA and Stream SDK respectively. Other GPU programming languages include BrookGPU, PeakStream, and RapidMind. Nvidia has also released specific products for computation in their Tesla series. The technology consortium Khronos Group has released the OpenCL specification, which is a framework for writing programs that execute across platforms consisting of CPUs and GPUs. AMD, Apple, Intel, Nvidia and others are supporting OpenCL.\n\nApplication-specific integrated circuits[edit]\n\nSeveral application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) approaches have been devised for dealing with parallel applications.[62][63][64]\nBecause an ASIC is (by definition) specific to a given application, it can be fully optimized for that application. As a result, for a given application, an ASIC tends to outperform a general-purpose computer. However, ASICs are created by UV photolithography. This process requires a mask set, which can be extremely expensive. A mask set can cost over a million US dollars.[65] (The smaller the transistors required for the chip, the more expensive the mask will be.) Meanwhile, performance increases in general-purpose computing over time (as described by Moore's law) tend to wipe out these gains in only one or two chip generations.[60] High initial cost, and the tendency to be overtaken by Moore's-law-driven general-purpose computing, has rendered ASICs unfeasible for most parallel computing applications. However, some have been built. One example is the PFLOPS RIKEN MDGRAPE-3 machine which uses custom ASICs for molecular dynamics simulation.\n\n\n\nThe Cray-1 is a vector processor.\nA vector processor is a CPU or computer system that can execute the same instruction on large sets of data. Vector processors have high-level operations that work on linear arrays of numbers or vectors. An example vector operation is A = B × C, where A, B, and C are each 64-element vectors of 64-bit floating-point numbers.[66] They are closely related to Flynn's SIMD classification.[66]\nCray computers became famous for their vector-processing computers in the 1970s and 1980s. However, vector processors—both as CPUs and as full computer systems—have generally disappeared. Modern processor instruction sets do include some vector processing instructions, such as with Freescale Semiconductor's AltiVec and Intel's Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE).\n\n\nParallel programming languages[edit]\n\nConcurrent programming languages, libraries, APIs, and parallel programming models (such as algorithmic skeletons) have been created for programming parallel computers. These can generally be divided into classes based on the assumptions they make about the underlying memory architecture—shared memory, distributed memory, or shared distributed memory. Shared memory programming languages communicate by manipulating shared memory variables. Distributed memory uses message passing. POSIX Threads and OpenMP are two of the most widely used shared memory APIs, whereas Message Passing Interface (MPI) is the most widely used message-passing system API.[67] One concept used in programming parallel programs is the future concept, where one part of a program promises to deliver a required datum to another part of a program at some future time.\nEfforts to standardize parallel programming include an open standard called OpenHMPP for hybrid multi-core parallel programming. The OpenHMPP directive-based programming model offers a syntax to efficiently offload computations on hardware accelerators and to optimize data movement to/from the hardware memory using remote procedure calls.\nThe rise of consumer GPUs has led to support for compute kernels, either in graphics  APIs (referred to as compute shaders), in dedicated APIs (such as OpenCL), or in other language extensions.\n\nAutomatic parallelization[edit]\n\nAutomatic parallelization of a sequential program by a compiler is the \"holy grail\" of parallel computing, especially with the aforementioned limit of processor frequency. Despite decades of work by compiler researchers, automatic parallelization has had only limited success.[68]\nMainstream parallel programming languages remain either explicitly parallel or (at best) partially implicit, in which a programmer gives the compiler directives for parallelization. A few fully implicit parallel programming languages exist—SISAL, Parallel Haskell, SequenceL, SystemC (for FPGAs), Mitrion-C, VHDL, and Verilog.\n\nApplication checkpointing[edit]\n\nAs a computer system grows in complexity, the mean time between failures usually decreases. Application checkpointing is a technique whereby the computer system takes a \"snapshot\" of the application—a record of all current resource allocations and variable states, akin to a core dump—; this information can be used to restore the program if the computer should fail. Application checkpointing means that the program has to restart from only its last checkpoint rather than the beginning. While checkpointing provides benefits in a variety of situations, it is especially useful in highly parallel systems with a large number of processors used in high performance computing.[69]\n\nAlgorithmic methods[edit]\nAs parallel computers become larger and faster, we are now able to solve problems that had previously taken too long to run. Fields as varied as bioinformatics (for protein folding and sequence analysis) and economics have taken advantage of parallel computing. Common types of problems in parallel computing applications include:[70]\n\nDense linear algebra\nSparse linear algebra\nSpectral methods (such as Cooley–Tukey fast Fourier transform)\nN-body problems (such as Barnes–Hut simulation)\nStructured grid problems (such as Lattice Boltzmann methods)\nUnstructured grid problems (such as found in finite element analysis)\nMonte Carlo method\nCombinational logic (such as brute-force cryptographic techniques)\nGraph traversal (such as sorting algorithms)\nDynamic programming\nBranch and bound methods\nGraphical models (such as detecting hidden Markov models and constructing Bayesian networks)\nHBJ model, a concise message-passing model[71]\nFinite-state machine simulation\n\n\nParallel computing can also be applied to the design of fault-tolerant computer systems, particularly via lockstep systems performing the same operation in parallel. This provides redundancy in case one component fails, and also allows automatic error detection and error correction if the results differ. These methods can be used to help prevent single-event upsets caused by transient errors.[72] Although additional measures may be required in embedded or specialized systems, this method can provide a cost-effective approach to achieve n-modular redundancy in commercial off-the-shelf systems.\n\n\n\nILLIAC IV, \"the most infamous of supercomputers\"[73]\nThe origins of true (MIMD) parallelism go back to Luigi Federico Menabrea and his Sketch of the Analytic Engine Invented by Charles Babbage.[74][75][76]\nIn 1957, Compagnie des Machines Bull announced the first computer architecture specifically designed for parallelism, the Gamma 60.[77] It utilized a fork-join model and a \"Program Distributor\" to dispatch and collect data to and from independent processing units connected to a central memory.[78][79]\nIn April 1958, Stanley Gill (Ferranti) discussed parallel programming and the need for branching and waiting.[80] Also in 1958, IBM researchers John Cocke and Daniel Slotnick discussed the use of parallelism in numerical calculations for the first time.[81] Burroughs Corporation introduced the D825 in 1962, a four-processor computer that accessed up to 16 memory modules through a crossbar switch.[82] In 1967, Amdahl and Slotnick published a debate about the feasibility of parallel processing at American Federation of Information Processing Societies Conference.[81] It was during this debate that Amdahl's law was coined to define the limit of speed-up due to parallelism.\nIn 1969, Honeywell introduced its first Multics system, a symmetric multiprocessor system capable of running up to eight processors in parallel.[81] C.mmp, a multi-processor project at Carnegie Mellon University in the 1970s, was among the first multiprocessors with more than a few processors. The first bus-connected multiprocessor with snooping caches was the Synapse N+1 in 1984.[75]\nSIMD parallel computers can be traced back to the 1970s. The motivation behind early SIMD computers was to amortize the gate delay of the processor's control unit over multiple instructions.[83] In 1964, Slotnick had proposed building a massively parallel computer for the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.[81] His design was funded by the US Air Force, which was the earliest SIMD parallel-computing effort, ILLIAC IV.[81] The key to its design was a fairly high parallelism, with up to 256 processors, which allowed the machine to work on large datasets in what would later be known as vector processing. However, ILLIAC IV was called \"the most infamous of supercomputers\", because the project was only one-fourth completed, but took 11 years and cost almost four times the original estimate.[73] When it was finally ready to run its first real application in 1976, it was outperformed by existing commercial supercomputers such as the Cray-1.\n\nBiological brain as massively parallel computer[edit]\nIn the early 1970s, at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert started developing the Society of Mind theory, which views the biological brain as massively parallel computer. In 1986, Minsky published The Society of Mind, which claims that \"mind is formed from many little agents, each mindless by itself\".[84] The theory attempts to explain how what we call intelligence could be a product of the interaction of non-intelligent parts. Minsky says that the biggest source of ideas about the theory came from his work in trying to create a machine that uses a robotic arm, a video camera, and a computer to build with children's blocks.[85]\nSimilar models (which also view the biological brain as a massively parallel computer, i.e., the brain is made up of a constellation of independent or semi-independent agents) were also described by:\n\nThomas R. Blakeslee,[86]\nMichael S. Gazzaniga,[87][88]\nRobert E. Ornstein,[89]\nErnest Hilgard,[90][91]\nMichio Kaku,[92]\nGeorge Ivanovich Gurdjieff,[93]\nNeurocluster Brain Model.[94]\n\n\nComputer multitasking\nConcurrency (computer science)\nContent Addressable Parallel Processor\nList of distributed computing conferences\nLoop-level parallelism\nManchester dataflow machine\nManycore\nParallel programming model\nParallelization contract\nSerializability\nSynchronous programming\nTransputer\nVector processing\n\n\n\n^ Gottlieb, Allan; Almasi, George S.

Spark provides an interface for programming clusters with implicit data parallelism and fault tolerance. Originally developed at the University of California, Berkeley's AMPLab starting in 2009, in 2013, the Spark codebase was donated to the Apache Software Foundation, which has maintained it since.\n\n\n\nApache Spark has its architectural foundation in the resilient distributed dataset (RDD), a read-only multiset of data items distributed over a cluster of machines, that is maintained in a fault-tolerant way.[2] The Dataframe API was released as an abstraction on top of the RDD, followed by the Dataset API. In Spark 1.x, the RDD was the primary application programming interface (API), but as of Spark 2.x use of the Dataset API is encouraged[3] even though the RDD API is not deprecated.[4][5] The RDD technology still underlies the Dataset API.[6][7]\nSpark and its RDDs were developed in 2012 in response to limitations in the MapReduce cluster computing paradigm, which forces a particular linear dataflow structure on distributed programs: MapReduce programs read input data from disk, map a function across the data, reduce the results of the map, and store reduction results on disk. Spark's RDDs function as a working set for distributed programs that offers a (deliberately) restricted form of distributed shared memory.[8]\nInside Apache Spark the workflow is managed as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Nodes represent RDDs while edges represent the operations on the RDDs.\nSpark facilitates the implementation of both iterative algorithms, which visit their data set multiple times in a loop, and interactive/exploratory data analysis, i.e., the repeated database-style querying of data. The latency of such applications may be reduced by several orders of magnitude compared to Apache Hadoop MapReduce implementation.[2][9]\nAmong the class of iterative algorithms are the training algorithms for machine learning systems, which formed the initial impetus for developing Apache Spark.[10]\nApache Spark requires a cluster manager and a distributed storage system. For cluster management, Spark supports standalone native Spark, Hadoop YARN, Apache Mesos or Kubernetes.[11] A standalone native Spark cluster can be launched manually or by the launch scripts provided by the install package.  It is also possible to run the daemons on a single machine for testing.  For distributed storage Spark can interface with a wide variety of distributed systems, including Alluxio, Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS),[12] MapR File System (MapR-FS),[13] Cassandra,[14] OpenStack Swift, Amazon S3, Kudu, Lustre file system,[15] or a custom solution can be implemented. Spark also supports a pseudo-distributed local mode, usually used only for development or testing purposes, where distributed storage is not required and the local file system can be used instead; in such a scenario, Spark is run on a single machine with one executor per CPU core.\n\n\nSpark Core is the foundation of the overall project. It provides distributed task dispatching, scheduling, and basic I/O functionalities, exposed through an application programming interface (for Java, Python, Scala, .NET[16] and R) centered on the RDD abstraction (the Java API is available for other JVM languages, but is also usable for some other non-JVM languages that can connect to the JVM, such as Julia[17]). This interface mirrors a functional/higher-order model of programming: a \"driver\" program invokes parallel operations such as map, filter or reduce on an RDD by passing a function to Spark, which then schedules the function's execution in parallel on the cluster.[2] These operations, and additional ones such as joins, take RDDs as input and produce new RDDs. RDDs are immutable and their operations are lazy; fault-tolerance is achieved by keeping track of the \"lineage\" of each RDD (the sequence of operations that produced it) so that it can be reconstructed in the case of data loss. RDDs can contain any type of Python, .NET, Java, or Scala objects.\nBesides the RDD-oriented functional style of programming, Spark provides two restricted forms of shared variables: broadcast variables reference read-only data that needs to be available on all nodes, while accumulators can be used to program reductions in an imperative style.[2]\nA typical example of RDD-centric functional programming is the following Scala program that computes the frequencies of all words occurring in a set of text files and prints the most common ones. Each map, flatMap (a variant of map) and reduceByKey takes an anonymous function that performs a simple operation on a single data item (or a pair of items), and applies its argument to transform an RDD into a new RDD.\n\nimport org.apache.spark.{SparkConf, SparkContext}\nimport org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD\n\nval conf: SparkConf = new SparkConf().setAppName(\"wiki_test\") // create a spark config object\nval sc: SparkContext = new SparkContext(conf) // Create a spark context\nval data: RDD[String] = sc.textFile(\"/path/to/somedir\") // Read files from \"somedir\" into an RDD of (filename, content) pairs.\nval tokens: RDD[String] = data.flatMap(_.split(\" \")) // Split each file into a list of tokens (words).\nval wordFreq: RDD[(String, Int)] = tokens.map((_, 1)).reduceByKey(_ + _) // Add a count of one to each token, then sum the counts per word type.\nval topWords: Array[(Int, String)] = wordFreq.sortBy(s => -s._2).map(x => (x._2, x._1)).top(10) // Get the top 10 words. Swap word and count to sort by count.\n\n\nSpark SQL is a component on top of Spark Core that introduced a data abstraction called DataFrames,[a] which provides support for structured and semi-structured data. Spark SQL provides a domain-specific language (DSL) to manipulate DataFrames in Scala, Java, Python or .NET.[16] It also provides SQL language support, with command-line interfaces and ODBC/JDBC server. Although DataFrames lack the compile-time type-checking afforded by RDDs, as of Spark 2.0, the strongly typed DataSet is fully supported by Spark SQL as well.\n\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.{DataFrame, SparkSession}\n\nval url: String = \"jdbc:mysql://yourIP:yourPort/test?user=yourUsername;password=yourPassword\" // URL for your database server.\nval spark: SparkSession = SparkSession.builder().getOrCreate() // Create a Spark session object\n\nval df: DataFrame = spark\n  .read\n  .format(\"jdbc\")\n  .option(\"url\", url)\n  .option(\"dbtable\", \"people\")\n  .load()\n\ndf.printSchema() // Looks at the schema of this DataFrame.\nval countsByAge: DataFrame = df.groupBy(\"age\").count() // Counts people by age\n\nOr alternatively via SQL:\n\ndf.createOrReplaceTempView(\"people\")\nval countsByAge: DataFrame = spark.sql(\"SELECT age, count(*) FROM people GROUP BY age\")\n\n\nSpark Streaming uses Spark Core's fast scheduling capability to perform streaming analytics. It ingests data in mini-batches and performs RDD transformations on those mini-batches of data. This design enables the same set of application code written for batch analytics to be used in streaming analytics, thus facilitating easy implementation of lambda architecture.[19][20] However, this convenience comes with the penalty of latency equal to the mini-batch duration. Other streaming data engines that process event by event rather than in mini-batches include Storm and the streaming component of Flink.[21] Spark Streaming has support built-in to consume from Kafka, Flume, Twitter, ZeroMQ, Kinesis, and TCP/IP sockets.[22]\nIn Spark 2.x, a separate technology based on Datasets, called Structured Streaming, that has a higher-level interface is also provided to support streaming.[23]\nSpark can be deployed in a traditional on-premises data center as well as in the cloud.[24]\n\nMLlib machine learning library[edit]\nSpark MLlib is a distributed machine-learning framework on top of Spark Core that, due in large part to the distributed memory-based Spark architecture, is as much as nine times as fast as the disk-based implementation used by Apache Mahout (according to benchmarks done by the MLlib developers against the alternating least squares (ALS) implementations, and before Mahout itself gained a Spark interface), and scales better than Vowpal Wabbit.[25] Many common machine learning and statistical algorithms have been implemented and are shipped with MLlib which simplifies large scale machine learning pipelines, including:\n\nsummary statistics, correlations, stratified sampling, hypothesis testing, random data generation[26]\nclassification and regression: support vector machines, logistic regression, linear regression, naive Bayes classification, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient-Boosted Tree\ncollaborative filtering techniques including alternating least squares (ALS)\ncluster analysis methods including k-means, and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)\ndimensionality reduction techniques such as singular value decomposition (SVD), and principal component analysis (PCA)\nfeature extraction and transformation functions\noptimization algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent, limited-memory BFGS (L-BFGS)\n\nGraphX is a distributed graph-processing framework on top of Apache Spark. Because it is based on RDDs, which are immutable, graphs are immutable and thus GraphX is unsuitable for graphs that need to be updated, let alone in a transactional manner like a graph database.[27] GraphX provides two separate APIs for implementation of massively parallel algorithms (such as PageRank): a Pregel abstraction, and a more general MapReduce-style API.[28] Unlike its predecessor Bagel, which was formally deprecated in Spark 1.6, GraphX has full support for property graphs (graphs where properties can be attached to edges and vertices).[29]\nLike Apache Spark, GraphX initially started as a research project at UC Berkeley's AMPLab and Databricks, and was later donated to the Apache Software Foundation and the Spark project.[30]\n\n\nApache Spark has built-in support for Scala, Java, SQL, R, Python, and Swift with 3rd party support for the .NET CLR,[31] Julia,[32] and more.\n\n\nSpark was initially started by Matei Zaharia at UC Berkeley's AMPLab in 2009, and open sourced in 2010 under a BSD license.[33]\nIn 2013, the project was donated to the Apache Software Foundation and switched its license to Apache 2.0. In February 2014, Spark became a Top-Level Apache Project.[34]\nIn November 2014, Spark founder M. Zaharia's company Databricks set a new world record in large scale sorting using Spark.[35][33]\nSpark had in excess of 1000 contributors in 2015,[36] making it one of the most active projects in the Apache Software Foundation[37] and one of the most active open source big data projects.\n\n\n\n\nVersion\n\nOriginal release date\n\nLatest version\n\nRelease date\n\n\n 0.5\n\n2012-06-12\n\n0.5.2\n\n2012-11-22\n\n\n 0.6\n\n2012-10-15\n\n0.6.2\n\n2013-02-07\n\n\n 0.7\n\n2013-02-27\n\n0.7.3\n\n2013-07-16\n\n\n 0.8\n\n2013-09-25\n\n0.8.1\n\n2013-12-19\n\n\n 0.9\n\n2014-02-02\n\n0.9.2\n\n2014-07-23\n\n\n 1.0\n\n2014-05-26\n\n1.0.2\n\n2014-08-05\n\n\n 1.1\n\n2014-09-11\n\n1.1.1\n\n2014-11-26\n\n\n 1.2\n\n2014-12-18\n\n1.2.2\n\n2015-04-17\n\n\n 1.3\n\n2015-03-13\n\n1.3.1\n\n2015-04-17\n\n\n 1.4\n\n2015-06-11\n\n1.4.1\n\n2015-07-15\n\n\n 1.5\n\n2015-09-09\n\n1.5.2\n\n2015-11-09\n\n\n 1.6\n\n2016-01-04\n\n1.6.3\n\n2016-11-07\n\n\n 2.0\n\n2016-07-26\n\n2.0.2\n\n2016-11-14\n\n\n 2.1\n\n2016-12-28\n\n2.1.3\n\n2018-06-26\n\n\n 2.2\n\n2017-07-11\n\n2.2.3\n\n2019-01-11\n\n\n 2.3\n\n2018-02-28\n\n2.3.4\n\n2019-09-09\n\n\n 2.4 LTS\n\n2018-11-02\n\n2.4.8\n\n2021-05-17[38]\n\n\n 3.0\n\n2020-06-18\n\n3.0.3\n\n2021-06-01[39]\n\n\n 3.1\n\n2021-03-02\n\n3.1.3\n\n2022-02-18[40]\n\n\n 3.2\n\n2021-10-13\n\n3.2.4\n\n2023-04-13[41]\n\n\n 3.3\n\n2022-06-16\n\n3.3.3\n\n2023-08-21[42]\n\n\n 3.4\n\n2023-04-13\n\n3.4.4\n\n2024-10-27[43]\n\n\n 3.5 LTS\n\n2023-09-09\n\n3.5.6\n\n2025-05-29[44]\n\n\n 4.0\n\n2025-05-23\n\n4.0.0\n\n2025-05-23[45]\n\n\nLegend:UnsupportedSupportedLatest versionPreview version\n\n\nSpark 3.5.2 is based on Scala 2.13 (and thus works with Scala 2.12 and 2.13 out-of-the-box), but it can also be made to work with Scala 3.[46]\n\n\nApache Spark is developed by a community. The project is managed by a group called the \"Project Management Committee\" (PMC).[47]\n\nMaintenance releases and EOL[edit]\nFeature release branches will, generally, be maintained with bug fix releases for a period of 18 months. For example, branch 2.3.x is no longer considered maintained as of September 2019, 18 months after the release of 2.3.0 in February 2018. No more 2.3.x releases should be expected after that point, even for bug fixes.\nThe last minor release within a major a release will typically be maintained for longer as an “LTS” release. For example, 2.4.0 was released on November 2, 2018, and had been maintained for 31 months until 2.4.8 was released in May 2021. 2.4.8 is the last release and no more 2.4.x releases should be expected even for bug fixes.[48]\n\n\nBig data\nDistributed computing\nDistributed data processing\nList of Apache Software Foundation projects\nList of concurrent and parallel programming languages\nMapReduce\n\n\n^ Called SchemaRDDs before Spark 1.3[18]\n\n\n\n\n^ \"Spark Release 2.0.0\".

    "content": "Cloud computing metaphor: the group of networked elements providing services does not need to be addressed or managed individually by users; instead, the entire provider-managed suite of hardware and software can be thought of as an amorphous cloud.\nCloud computing is defined by the ISO as \"a paradigm for enabling network access to a scalable and elastic pool of shareable physical or virtual resources with self-service provisioning and administration on demand\".[1] It is commonly referred to as \"the cloud\".[2]\n\n\nCharacteristics\nIn 2011, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) identified five \"essential characteristics\" for cloud systems.[3] Below are the exact definitions according to NIST:[3]\n\nOn-demand self-service: \"A consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service provider.\"\nBroad network access: \"Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations).\"\nResource pooling: \" The provider's computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand.\"\nRapid elasticity: \"Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases automatically, to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand. To the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear unlimited and can be appropriated in any quantity at any time.\"\nMeasured service: \"Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts). Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service.\nBy 2023, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) had expanded and refined the list.[4]\n\nHistory\n\nThe history of cloud computing extends to the 1960s, with the initial concepts of time-sharing becoming popularized via remote job entry (RJE). The \"data center\" model, where users submitted jobs to operators to run on mainframes, was predominantly used during this era. This period saw broad experimentation with making large-scale computing power more accessible through time-sharing, while optimizing infrastructure, platforms, and applications to improve efficiency for end users.[5]\nThe \"cloud\" metaphor for virtualized services dates to 1994, when it was used by General Magic for the universe of \"places\" that mobile agents in the Telescript environment could \"go\". The metaphor is credited to David Hoffman, a General Magic communications specialist, based on its long-standing use in networking and telecom.[6] The expression cloud computing became more widely known in 1996 when Compaq Computer Corporation drew up a business plan for future computing and the Internet. The company's ambition was to supercharge sales with \"cloud computing-enabled applications\". The business plan foresaw that online consumer file storage would likely be commercially successful. As a result, Compaq decided to sell server hardware to internet service providers.[7]\nIn the 2000s, the application of cloud computing began to take shape with the establishment of Amazon Web Services (AWS) in 2002, which allowed developers to build applications independently. In 2006 Amazon Simple Storage Service, known as Amazon S3, and the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) were released. In 2008 NASA's development of the first open-source software for deploying private and hybrid clouds.[8][9]\nThe following decade saw the launch of various cloud services. In 2010, Microsoft launched Microsoft Azure, and Rackspace Hosting and NASA initiated an open-source cloud-software project, OpenStack. IBM introduced the IBM SmartCloud framework in 2011, and Oracle announced the Oracle Cloud in 2012. In December 2019, Amazon launched AWS Outposts, a service that extends AWS infrastructure, services, APIs, and tools to customer data centers, co-location spaces, or on-premises facilities.[10][11]\n\nValue proposition\n\nCloud computing can shorten time to market by offering pre-configured tools, scalable resources, and managed services, allowing users to focus on core business value rather than maintaining infrastructure. Cloud platforms can enable organizations and individuals to reduce upfront capital expenditures on physical infrastructure by shifting to an operational expenditure model, where costs scale with usage. Cloud platforms also offer managed services and tools, such as artificial intelligence, data analytics, and machine learning, which might otherwise require significant in-house expertise and infrastructure investment.[12][13][14]\nWhile cloud computing can offer cost advantages through effective resource optimization, organizations often face challenges such as unused resources, inefficient configurations, and hidden costs without proper oversight and governance. Many cloud platforms provide cost management tools, such as AWS Cost Explorer and Azure Cost Management, and frameworks like FinOps have emerged to standardize financial operations in the cloud. Cloud computing also facilitates collaboration, remote work, and global service delivery by enabling secure access to data and applications from any location with an internet connection.[12][13][14]\nCloud providers offer various redundancy options for core services, such as managed storage and managed databases, though redundancy configurations often vary by service tier. Advanced redundancy strategies, such as cross-region replication or failover systems, typically require explicit configuration and may incur additional costs or licensing fees.[12][13][14]\nCloud environments operate under a shared responsibility model, where providers are typically responsible for infrastructure security, physical hardware, and software updates, while customers are accountable for data encryption, identity and access management (IAM), and application-level security. These responsibilities vary depending on the cloud service model—Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), or Software as a Service (SaaS)—with customers typically having more control and responsibility in IaaS environments and progressively less in PaaS and SaaS models, often trading control for convenience and managed services.[12][13][14]\n\nAdoption and suitability\n\nThe decision to adopt cloud computing or maintain on-premises infrastructure depends on factors such as scalability, cost structure, latency requirements, regulatory constraints, and infrastructure customization.[15][16][17][18]\nOrganizations with variable or unpredictable workloads, limited capital for upfront investments, or a focus on rapid scalability benefit from cloud adoption. Startups, SaaS companies, and e-commerce platforms often prefer the pay-as-you-go operational expenditure (OpEx) model of cloud infrastructure. Additionally, companies prioritizing global accessibility, remote workforce enablement, disaster recovery, and leveraging advanced services such as AI/ML and analytics are well-suited for the cloud. In recent years, some cloud providers have started offering specialized services for high-performance computing and low-latency applications, addressing some use cases previously exclusive to on-premises setups.[15][16][17][18]\nOn the other hand, organizations with strict regulatory requirements, highly predictable workloads, or reliance on deeply integrated legacy systems may find cloud infrastructure less suitable. Businesses in industries like defense, government, or those handling highly sensitive data often favor on-premises setups for greater control and data sovereignty. Additionally, companies with ultra-low latency requirements, such as high-frequency trading (HFT) firms, rely on custom hardware (e.g., FPGAs) and physical proximity to exchanges, which most cloud providers cannot fully replicate despite recent advancements. Similarly, tech giants like Google, Meta, and Amazon build their own data centers due to economies of scale, predictable workloads, and the ability to customize hardware and network infrastructure for optimal efficiency. However, these companies also use cloud services selectively for certain workloads and applications where it aligns with their operational needs.[15][16][17][18]\nIn practice, many organizations are increasingly adopting hybrid cloud architectures, combining on-premises infrastructure with cloud services. This approach allows businesses to balance scalability, cost-effectiveness, and control, offering the benefits of both deployment models while mitigating their respective limitations.[15][16][17][18]\n\nChallenges and limitations\n\nOne of the primary challenges of cloud computing, compared with traditional on-premises systems, is maintaining data security and privacy. Cloud users entrust their sensitive data to third-party providers, who may not have adequate measures to protect it from unauthorized access, breaches, or leaks. Cloud users also face compliance risks if they have to adhere to certain regulations or standards regarding data protection, such as GDPR or HIPAA.[19]\nAnother challenge of cloud computing is reduced visibility and control. Cloud users may not have full insight into how their cloud resources are managed, configured, or optimized by their providers. They may also have limited ability to customize or modify their cloud services according to their specific needs or preferences.[19] Complete understanding of all technology may be impossible, especially given the scale, complexity, and deliberate opacity of contemporary systems; however, there is a need for understanding complex technologies and their interconnections to have power and agency within them.[20] The metaphor of the cloud can be seen as problematic as cloud computing retains the aura of something noumenal and numinous; it is something experienced without precisely understanding what it is or how it works.[21]\nAdditionally, cloud migration is a significant challenge. This process involves transferring data, applications, or workloads from one cloud environment to another, or from on-premises infrastructure to the cloud. Cloud migration can be complicated, time-consuming, and expensive, particularly when there are compatibility issues between different cloud platforms or architectures. If not carefully planned and executed, cloud migration can lead to downtime, reduced performance, or even data loss.[22]\n\nCloud migration challenges\nAccording to the 2024 State of the Cloud Report by Flexera, approximately 50% of respondents identified the following top challenges when migrating workloads to public clouds:[23]\n\n\"Understanding application dependencies\"\n\"Comparing on-premise and cloud costs\"\n\"Assessing technical feasibility.\"\nImplementation challenges\nApplications hosted in the cloud are susceptible to the fallacies of distributed computing, a series of misconceptions that can lead to significant issues in software development and deployment.[24]\n\nCloud cost overruns\nIn a report by Gartner, a survey of 200 IT leaders revealed that 69% experienced budget overruns in their organizations' cloud expenditures during 2023. Conversely, 31% of IT leaders whose organizations stayed within budget attributed their success to accurate forecasting and budgeting, proactive monitoring of spending, and effective optimization.[25]\nThe 2024 Flexera State of Cloud Report identifies the top cloud challenges as managing cloud spend, followed by security concerns and lack of expertise. Public cloud expenditures exceeded budgeted amounts by an average of 15%. The report also reveals that cost savings is the top cloud initiative for 60% of respondents. Furthermore, 65% measure cloud progress through cost savings, while 42% prioritize shorter time-to-market, indicating that cloud's promise of accelerated deployment is often overshadowed by cost concerns.[23]\n\nService Level Agreements\nTypically, cloud providers' Service Level Agreements (SLAs) do not encompass all forms of service interruptions. Exclusions typically include planned maintenance, downtime resulting from external factors such as network issues, human errors, like misconfigurations, natural disasters, force majeure events, or security breaches. Typically, customers bear the responsibility of monitoring SLA compliance and must file claims for any unmet SLAs within a designated timeframe. Customers should be aware of how deviations from SLAs are calculated, as these parameters may vary by service. These requirements can place a considerable burden on customers. Additionally, SLA percentages and conditions can differ across various services within the same provider, with some services lacking any SLA altogether. In cases of service interruptions due to hardware failures in the cloud provider, the company typically does not offer monetary compensation. Instead, eligible users may receive credits as outlined in the corresponding SLA.[26][27][28][29]\n\nLeaky abstractions\nCloud computing abstractions aim to simplify resource management, but leaky abstractions can expose underlying complexities. These variations in abstraction quality depend on the cloud vendor, service and architecture. Mitigating leaky abstractions requires users to understand the implementation details and limitations of the cloud services they utilize.[30][31][32]\n\nService lock-in within the same vendor\nService lock-in within the same vendor occurs when a customer becomes dependent on specific services within a cloud vendor, making it challenging to switch to alternative services within the same vendor when their needs change.[33][34]\n\nSecurity and privacy\nCloud suppliers security and privacy agreements must be aligned to the demand(s) requirements and regulations.\n\nCloud computing poses privacy concerns because the service provider can access the data that is in the cloud at any time.  It could accidentally or deliberately alter or delete information.[35] Many cloud providers can share information with third parties if necessary for purposes of law and order without a warrant. That is permitted in their privacy policies, which users must agree to before they start using cloud services. Solutions to privacy include policy and legislation as well as end-users' choices for how data is stored.[35] Users can encrypt data that is processed or stored within the cloud to prevent unauthorized access.[35] Identity management systems can also provide practical solutions to privacy concerns in cloud computing. These systems distinguish between authorized and unauthorized users and determine the amount of data that is accessible to each entity.[36] The systems work by creating and describing identities, recording activities, and getting rid of unused identities.\nAccording to the Cloud Security Alliance, the top three threats in the cloud are Insecure Interfaces and APIs, Data Loss & Leakage, and Hardware Failure—which accounted for 29%, 25% and 10% of all cloud security outages respectively. Together, these form shared technology vulnerabilities. In a cloud provider platform being shared by different users, there may be a possibility that information belonging to different customers resides on the same data server. Additionally, Eugene Schultz, chief technology officer at Emagined Security, said that hackers are spending substantial time and effort looking for ways to penetrate the cloud. \"There are some real Achilles' heels in the cloud infrastructure that are making big holes for the bad guys to get into\". Because data from hundreds or thousands of companies can be stored on large cloud servers, hackers can theoretically gain control of huge stores of information through a single attack—a process he called \"hyperjacking\". Some examples of this include the Dropbox security breach, and iCloud 2014 leak.[37] Dropbox had been breached in October 2014, having over seven million of its users passwords stolen by hackers in an effort to get monetary value from it by Bitcoins (BTC). By having these passwords, they are able to read private data as well as have this data be indexed by search engines (making the information public).[37]\nThere is the problem of legal ownership of the data (If a user stores some data in the cloud, can the cloud provider profit from it?). Many Terms of Service agreements are silent on the question of ownership.[38] Physical control of the computer equipment (private cloud) is more secure than having the equipment off-site and under someone else's control (public cloud). This delivers great incentive to public cloud computing service providers to prioritize building and maintaining strong management of secure services.[39] Some small businesses that do not have expertise in IT security could find that it is more secure for them to use a public cloud. There is the risk that end users do not understand the issues involved when signing on to a cloud service (persons sometimes do not read the many pages of the terms of service agreement, and just click \"Accept\" without reading). This is important now that cloud computing is common and required for some services to work, for example for an intelligent personal assistant (Apple's Siri or Google Assistant). Fundamentally, private cloud is seen as more secure with higher levels of control for the owner, however public cloud is seen to be more flexible and requires less time and money investment from the user.[40]\nThe attacks that can be made on cloud computing systems include man-in-the middle attacks, phishing attacks, authentication attacks, and malware attacks. One of the largest threats is considered to be malware attacks, such as Trojan horses. Recent research conducted in 2022 has revealed that the Trojan horse injection method is a serious problem with harmful impacts on cloud computing systems.[41]\n\nCloud Act\nThe CLOUD Act allows United States authorities to request data from cloud providers and other covered service providers regardless of where the data is physically stored.[42][43] The act is not limited to companies based in the United States. It applies to \"all electronic communication service or remote computing service providers that operate or have a legal presence in the U.S\".[44] Courts can require parent companies to provide data held by their subsidiaries.[45]\n\nService models\n\nComparison of on-premise, IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS\nCloud computing service models arranged as layers in a stack\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology recognized three cloud service models in 2011: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).[3] The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) later identified additional models in 2023, including \"Network as a Service\", \"Communications as a Service\", \"Compute as a Service\", and \"Data Storage as a Service\".[4]\n\nInfrastructure as a service (IaaS)\n\nInfrastructure as a service (IaaS) refers to online services that provide high-level APIs used to abstract various low-level details of underlying network infrastructure like physical computing resources, location, data partitioning, scaling, security, backup, etc. A hypervisor runs the virtual machines as guests. Pools of hypervisors within the cloud operational system can support large numbers of virtual machines and the ability to scale services up and down according to customers' varying requirements. Linux containers run in isolated partitions of a single Linux kernel running directly on the physical hardware. Linux cgroups and namespaces are the underlying Linux kernel technologies used to isolate, secure and manage the containers. The use of containers offers higher performance than virtualization because there is no hypervisor overhead. IaaS clouds often offer additional resources such as a virtual-machine disk-image library, raw block storage, file or object storage, firewalls, load balancers, IP addresses, virtual local area networks (VLANs), and software bundles.[46]\n\n\nThe NIST's definition of cloud computing describes IaaS as \"where the consumer is able to deploy and run arbitrary software, which can include operating systems and applications. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure but has control over operating systems, storage, and deployed applications; and possibly limited control of select networking components (e.g., host firewalls).\"[3]\nIaaS-cloud providers supply these resources on-demand from their large pools of equipment installed in data centers. For wide-area connectivity, customers can use either the Internet or carrier clouds (dedicated virtual private networks). To deploy their applications, cloud users install operating-system images and their application software on the cloud infrastructure. In this model, the cloud user patches and maintains the operating systems and the application software. Cloud providers typically bill IaaS services on a utility computing basis: cost reflects the number of resources allocated and consumed.[47]\n\nPlatform as a service (PaaS)\n\nThe NIST's definition of cloud computing defines Platform as a Service as:[3]\n\nThe capability provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the cloud infrastructure consumer-created or acquired applications created using programming languages, libraries, services, and tools supported by the provider. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, or storage, but has control over the deployed applications and possibly configuration settings for the application-hosting environment.\nPaaS vendors offer a development environment to application developers. The provider typically develops toolkit and standards for development and channels for distribution and payment. In the PaaS models, cloud providers deliver a computing platform, typically including an operating system, programming-language execution environment, database, and the web server. Application developers develop and run their software on a cloud platform instead of directly buying and managing the underlying hardware and software layers. With some PaaS, the underlying computer and storage resources scale automatically to match application demand so that the cloud user does not have to allocate resources manually.[48][need quotation to verify]\nSome integration and data management providers also use specialized applications of PaaS as delivery models for data. Examples include iPaaS (Integration Platform as a Service) and dPaaS (Data Platform as a Service). iPaaS enables customers to develop, execute and govern integration flows.[49] Under the iPaaS integration model, customers drive the development and deployment of integrations without installing or managing any hardware or middleware.[50] dPaaS delivers integration—and data-management—products as a fully managed service.[51] Under the dPaaS model, the PaaS provider, not the customer, manages the development and execution of programs by building data applications for the customer. dPaaS users access data through data-visualization tools.[52]\n\nSoftware as a service (SaaS)\n\nThe NIST's definition of cloud computing defines Software as a Service as:[3]\n\nThe capability provided to the consumer is to use the provider's applications running on a cloud infrastructure. The applications are accessible from various client devices through either a thin client interface, such as a web browser (e.g., web-based email), or a program interface. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, storage, or even individual application capabilities, with the possible exception of limited user-specific application configuration settings.\nIn the software as a service (SaaS) model, users gain access to application software and databases. Cloud providers manage the infrastructure and platforms that run the applications. SaaS is sometimes referred to as \"on-demand software\" and is usually priced on a pay-per-use basis or using a subscription fee.[53] In the SaaS model, cloud providers install and operate application software in the cloud and cloud users access the software from cloud clients. Cloud users do not manage the cloud infrastructure and platform where the application runs. This eliminates the need to install and run the application on the cloud user's own computers, which simplifies maintenance and support. Cloud applications differ from other applications in their scalability—which can be achieved by cloning tasks onto multiple virtual machines at run-time to meet changing work demand.[54] Load balancers distribute the work over the set of virtual machines. This process is transparent to the cloud user, who sees only a single access-point. To accommodate a large number of cloud users, cloud applications can be multitenant, meaning that any machine may serve more than one cloud-user organization.\nThe pricing model for SaaS applications is typically a monthly or yearly flat fee per user,[55] so prices become scalable and adjustable if users are added or removed at any point. It may also be free.[56] Proponents claim that SaaS gives a business the potential to reduce IT operational costs by outsourcing hardware and software maintenance and support to the cloud provider. This enables the business to reallocate IT operations costs away from hardware/software spending and from personnel expenses, towards meeting other goals. In addition, with applications hosted centrally, updates can be released without the need for users to install new software. One drawback of SaaS comes with storing the users' data on the cloud provider's server. As a result,[citation needed] there could be unauthorized access to the data.[57] Examples of applications offered as SaaS are games and productivity software like Google Docs and Office Online. SaaS applications may be integrated with cloud storage or File hosting services, which is the case with Google Docs being integrated with Google Drive, and Office Online being integrated with OneDrive.[58]\n\nServerless computing\n\nServerless computing allows customers to use various cloud capabilities without the need to provision, deploy, or manage hardware or software resources, apart from providing their application code or data. ISO/IEC 22123-2:2023 classifies serverless alongside Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS) under the broader category of cloud service categories. Notably, while ISO refers to these classifications as cloud service categories, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) refers to them as service models.[3][4]\n\nDeployment models\nCloud computing types\n\"A cloud deployment model represents the way in which cloud computing can be organized based on the control and sharing of physical or virtual resources.\"[4] Cloud deployment models define the fundamental patterns of interaction between cloud customers and cloud providers. They do not detail implementation specifics or the configuration of resources.[4]\n\nPrivate\nPrivate cloud is cloud infrastructure operated solely for a single organization, whether managed internally or by a third party, and hosted either internally or externally.[3] Undertaking a private cloud project requires significant engagement to virtualize the business environment, and requires the organization to reevaluate decisions about existing resources. It can improve business, but every step in the project raises security issues that must be addressed to prevent serious vulnerabilities. Self-run data centers[59] are generally capital intensive. They have a significant physical footprint, requiring allocations of space, hardware, and environmental controls. These assets have to be refreshed periodically, resulting in additional capital expenditures. They have attracted criticism because users \"still have to buy, build, and manage them\" and thus do not benefit from less hands-on management,[60] essentially \"[lacking] the economic model that makes cloud computing such an intriguing concept\".[61][62]\n\nPublic\n\nCloud services are considered \"public\" when they are delivered over the public Internet, and they may be offered as a paid subscription, or free of charge.[63] Architecturally, there are few differences between public- and private-cloud services, but security concerns increase substantially when services (applications, storage, and other resources) are shared by multiple customers. Most public-cloud providers offer direct-connection services that allow customers to securely link their legacy data centers to their cloud-resident applications.[64][65]\nSeveral factors like the functionality of the solutions, cost, integrational and organizational aspects as well as safety & security are influencing the decision of enterprises and organizations to choose a public cloud or on-premises solution.[66]\n\nHybrid\n\nHybrid cloud is a composition of a public cloud and a private environment, such as a private cloud or on-premises resources,[67][68] that remain distinct entities but are bound together, offering the benefits of multiple deployment models. Hybrid cloud can also mean the ability to connect collocation, managed or dedicated services with cloud resources.[3] Gartner defines a hybrid cloud service as a cloud computing service that is composed of some combination of private, public and community cloud services, from different service providers.[69] A hybrid cloud service crosses isolation and provider boundaries so that it cannot be simply put in one category of private, public, or community cloud service. It allows one to extend either the capacity or the capability of a cloud service, by aggregation, integration or customization with another cloud service.\nVaried use cases for hybrid cloud composition exist. For example, an organization may store sensitive client data in house on a private cloud application, but interconnect that application to a business intelligence application provided on a public cloud as a software service.[70] This example of hybrid cloud extends the capabilities of the enterprise to deliver a specific business service through the addition of externally available public cloud services. Hybrid cloud adoption depends on a number of factors such as data security and compliance requirements, level of control needed over data, and the applications an organization uses.[71]\nAnother example of hybrid cloud is one where IT organizations use public cloud computing resources to meet temporary capacity needs that can not be met by the private cloud.[72] This capability enables hybrid clouds to employ cloud bursting for scaling across clouds.[3] Cloud bursting is an application deployment model in which an application runs in a private cloud or data center and \"bursts\" to a public cloud when the demand for computing capacity increases. A primary advantage of cloud bursting and a hybrid cloud model is that an organization pays for extra compute resources only when they are needed.[73] Cloud bursting enables data centers to create an in-house IT infrastructure that supports average workloads, and use cloud resources from public or private clouds, during spikes in processing demands.[74]\n\n\nCommunity cloud shares infrastructure between several organizations from a specific community with common concerns (security, compliance, jurisdiction, etc.), whether it is managed internally or by a third-party, and hosted internally or externally, the costs are distributed among fewer users compared to a public cloud (but more than a private cloud). As a result, only a portion of the potential cost savings of cloud computing is achieved.\n[3]\n\nMulti cloud\n\nAccording to ISO/IEC 22123-1: \"multi-cloud is a cloud deployment model in which a customer uses public cloud services provided by two or more cloud service providers\".  [75] Poly cloud refers to the use of multiple public clouds for the purpose of leveraging specific services that each provider offers. It differs from Multi cloud in that it is not designed to increase flexibility or mitigate against failures but is rather used to allow an organization to achieve more than could be done with a single provider.[76]\n\nMarket\nAccording to International Data Corporation (IDC), global spending on cloud computing services has reached $706 billion and is expected to reach $1.3 trillion by 2025.[77] Gartner estimated that global public cloud services end-user spending would reach $600 billion by 2023.[78] According to a McKinsey & Company report, cloud cost-optimization levers and value-oriented business use cases foresee more than $1 trillion in run-rate EBITDA across Fortune 500 companies as up for grabs in 2030.[79] In 2022, more than $1.3 trillion in enterprise IT spending was at stake from the shift to the cloud, growing to almost $1.8 trillion in 2025, according to Gartner.[80]\nThe European Commission's 2012 Communication identified several issues which were impeding the development of the cloud computing market:[81]: Section 3 \n\nfragmentation of the digital single market across the EU\nconcerns about contracts including reservations about data access and ownership, data portability, and change control\nvariations in standards applicable to cloud computing\nThe Communication set out a series of \"digital agenda actions\" which the Commission proposed to undertake in order to support the development of a fair and effective market for cloud computing services.[81]: Pages 6–14 \n\nCloud Computing Vendors\nAs of 2025, the three largest cloud computing providers by market share, commonly referred to as hyperscalers, are Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud.[82][83] These companies dominate the global cloud market due to their extensive infrastructure, broad service offerings, and scalability. \nIn recent years, organizations have increasingly adopted alternative cloud providers, which offer specialized services that distinguish them from hyperscalers. These providers may offer advantages such as lower costs, improved cost transparency and predictability, enhanced data sovereignty (particularly within regions such as the European Union to comply with regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)), stronger alignment with local regulatory requirements, or industry-specific services.[84]\nAlternative cloud providers are often part of multi-cloud strategies, where organizations use multiple cloud services—both from hyperscalers and specialized providers—to optimize performance, compliance, and cost efficiency. However, they do not necessarily serve as direct replacements for hyperscalers, as their offerings are typically more specialized.[84]\n\nSimilar concepts\nThe goal of cloud computing is to allow users to take benefit from all of these technologies, without the need for deep knowledge about or expertise with each one of them. The cloud aims to cut costs and helps the users focus on their core business instead of being impeded by IT obstacles.[85] The main enabling technology for cloud computing is virtualization. Virtualization software separates a physical computing device into one or more \"virtual\" devices, each of which can be easily used and managed to perform computing tasks. With operating system–level virtualization essentially creating a scalable system of multiple independent computing devices, idle computing resources can be allocated and used more efficiently. Virtualization provides the agility required to speed up IT operations and reduces cost by increasing infrastructure utilization. Autonomic computing automates the process through which the user can provision resources on-demand. By minimizing user involvement, automation speeds up the process, reduces labor costs and reduces the possibility of human errors.[85]\nCloud computing uses concepts from utility computing to provide metrics for the services used. Cloud computing attempts to address QoS (quality of service) and reliability problems of other grid computing models.[85]\nCloud computing shares characteristics with:\n\nClient–server model – Client–server computing refers broadly to any distributed application that distinguishes between service providers (servers) and service requestors (clients).[86]\nComputer bureau – A service bureau providing computer services, particularly from the 1960s to 1980s.\nGrid computing – A form of distributed and parallel computing, whereby a 'super and virtual computer' is composed of a cluster of networked, loosely coupled computers acting in concert to perform very large tasks.\nFog computing – Distributed computing paradigm that provides data, compute, storage and application services closer to the client or near-user edge devices, such as network routers. Furthermore, fog computing handles data at the network level, on smart devices and on the end-user client-side (e.g. mobile devices), instead of sending data to a remote location for processing.\nUtility computing – The \"packaging of computing resources, such as computation and storage, as a metered service similar to a traditional public utility, such as electricity.\"[87][88]\nPeer-to-peer – A distributed architecture without the need for central coordination. Participants are both suppliers and consumers of resources (in contrast to the traditional client-server model).\nCloud sandbox – A live, isolated computer environment in which a program, code or file can run without affecting the application in which it runs.\nSee also\n\nBlock-level storage\nBrowser-based computing\nCategory:Cloud computing providers\nCategory:Cloud platforms\nCloud computing architecture\nCloud broker\nCloud collaboration\nCloud-computing comparison\nCloud computing security\nCloud gaming\nCloud management\nCloud-native computing\nCloud research\nCloud robotics\nCloud storage\nCloud-to-cloud integration\nCloudlet\nComputer cluster\nCooperative storage cloud\nDecentralized computing\nDesktop virtualization\nDew computing\nDirectory\nDistributed data store\nDistributed database\nDistributed computing\nDistributed networking\ne-Science\nEdge computing\nEdge device\nExchange-traded fund\nFile system\nClustered file system\nDistributed file system\nDistributed file system for cloud\nFog computing\nFog robotics\nGreen computing (environmentally sustainable computing)\nGrid computing\nIn-memory database\nIn-memory processing\nInternet of things\nIoT security device\nKnowledge as a service\nMicroservices\nMobile cloud computing\nMulti-access edge computing\nMultisite cloud\nPeer-to-peer\nPersonal cloud\nPrivate cloud computing infrastructure\nRobot as a service\nService-oriented architecture\nTime-sharing\nUbiquitous computing\nVirtual private cloud\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\n^ \"ISO/IEC 22123-1:2023(E) – Information technology – Cloud computing – Part 1: Vocabulary\".

    "content": "Bloch sphere representation of a qubit. The state is a point on the surface of the sphere, partway between the poles,  and .\nA quantum computer is a (real or theoretical) computer that exploits superposed and entangled states. Quantum computers can be viewed as sampling from quantum systems that evolve in ways that may be described as operating on an enormous number of possibilities simultaneously, though still subject to strict computational constraints. By contrast, ordinary (\"classical\") computers operate according to deterministic rules. (A classical computer can, in principle, be replicated by a classical mechanical device, with only a simple multiple of time cost. On the other hand (it is believed), a quantum computer would require exponentially more time and energy to be simulated classically.) It is widely believed that a quantum computer could perform some calculations exponentially faster than any classical computer. For example, a large-scale quantum computer could break some widely used public-key cryptographic schemes and aid physicists in performing physical simulations. However, current hardware implementations of quantum computation are largely experimental and only suitable for specialized tasks.\nThe basic unit of information in quantum computing, the qubit (or \"quantum bit\"), serves the same function as the bit in ordinary or \"classical\" computing.[1] However, unlike a classical bit, which can be in one of two states (a binary), a qubit can exist in a linear combination of two states known as a quantum superposition. The result of measuring a qubit is one of the two states given by a probabilistic rule. If a quantum computer manipulates the qubit in a particular way, wave interference effects amplify the probability of the desired measurement result. The design of quantum algorithms involves creating procedures that allow a quantum computer to perform this amplification.\nQuantum computers are not yet practical for real-world applications. Physically engineering high-quality qubits has proven to be challenging. If a physical qubit is not sufficiently isolated from its environment, it suffers from quantum decoherence, introducing noise into calculations. National governments have invested heavily in experimental research aimed at developing scalable qubits with longer coherence times and lower error rates. Example implementations include superconductors (which isolate an electrical current by eliminating electrical resistance) and ion traps (which confine a single atomic particle using electromagnetic fields). Researchers have claimed, and are widely believed to be correct, that certain quantum devices can outperform classical computers on narrowly defined tasks, a milestone referred to as quantum advantage or quantum supremacy. These tasks are not necessarily useful for real-world applications.\n\n\n\n\nFor many years, the fields of quantum mechanics and computer science formed distinct academic communities.[2] Modern quantum theory was developed in the 1920s to explain perplexing physical phenomena observed at atomic scales,[3][4] and digital computers emerged in the following decades to replace human computers for tedious calculations.[5] Both disciplines had practical applications during World War II; computers played a major role in wartime cryptography,[6] and quantum physics was essential for nuclear physics used in the Manhattan Project.[7]\nAs physicists applied quantum mechanical models to computational problems and swapped digital bits for qubits, the fields of quantum mechanics and computer science began to converge. In 1980, Paul Benioff introduced the quantum Turing machine, which uses quantum theory to describe a simplified computer.[8]\nWhen digital computers became faster, physicists faced an exponential increase in overhead when simulating quantum dynamics,[9] prompting Yuri Manin and Richard Feynman to independently suggest that hardware based on quantum phenomena might be more efficient for computer simulation.[10][11][12]\nIn a 1984 paper, Charles Bennett and Gilles Brassard applied quantum theory to cryptography protocols and demonstrated that quantum key distribution could enhance information security.[13][14]\nQuantum algorithms then emerged for solving oracle problems, such as Deutsch's algorithm in 1985,[15] the Bernstein–Vazirani algorithm in 1993,[16] and Simon's algorithm in 1994.[17]\nThese algorithms did not solve practical problems, but demonstrated mathematically that one could obtain more information by querying a black box with a quantum state in superposition, sometimes referred to as quantum parallelism.[18]\n\nPeter Shor (pictured here in 2017) showed in 1994 that a scalable quantum computer would be able to break RSA encryption.\nPeter Shor built on these results with his 1994 algorithm for breaking the widely used RSA and Diffie–Hellman encryption protocols,[19] which drew significant attention to the field of quantum computing. In 1996, Grover's algorithm established a quantum speedup for the widely applicable unstructured search problem.[20][21] The same year, Seth Lloyd proved that quantum computers could simulate quantum systems without the exponential overhead present in classical simulations,[22] validating Feynman's 1982 conjecture.[23]\nOver the years, experimentalists have constructed small-scale quantum computers using trapped ions and superconductors.[24]\nIn 1998, a two-qubit quantum computer demonstrated the feasibility of the technology,[25][26] and subsequent experiments have increased the number of qubits and reduced error rates.[24]\nIn 2019, Google AI and NASA announced that they had achieved quantum supremacy with a 54-qubit machine, performing a computation that any classical computer would find impossible.[27][28][29][30]\nThis announcement was met with a rebuttal from IBM, which contended that the calculation Google claimed would take 10,000 years could be performed in just 2.5 days on its  Summit supercomputer if its architecture were optimized, sparking a debate over the precise threshold for \"quantum supremacy\".[31]\n\nQuantum information processing[edit]\nComputer engineers typically describe a modern computer's operation in terms of classical electrodynamics. In these \"classical\" computers, some components (such as semiconductors and random number generators) may rely on quantum behavior; however, because they are not isolated from their environment, any quantum information eventually quickly decoheres. While programmers may depend on probability theory when designing a randomized algorithm, quantum-mechanical notions such as superposition and wave interference are largely irrelevant in program analysis.\nQuantum programs, in contrast, rely on precise control of coherent quantum systems. Physicists describe these systems mathematically using linear algebra. Complex numbers model probability amplitudes, vectors model quantum states, and matrices model the operations that can be performed on these states. Programming a quantum computer is then a matter of composing operations in such a way that the resulting program computes a useful result in theory and is implementable in practice.\nAs physicist Charlie Bennett describes the relationship between quantum and classical computers,[32]\n\nA classical computer is a quantum computer ... so we shouldn't be asking about \"where do quantum speedups come from?\" We should say, \"Well, all computers are quantum. ... Where do classical slowdowns come from?\"\nQuantum information[edit]\nJust as the bit is the basic concept of classical information theory, the qubit is the fundamental unit of quantum information. The same term qubit is used to refer to an abstract mathematical model and to any physical system that is represented by that model. A classical bit, by definition, exists in either of two physical states, which can be denoted 0 and 1. A qubit is also described by a state, and two states, often written  and , serve as the quantum counterparts of the classical states 0 and 1. However, the quantum states  and  belong to a vector space, meaning that they can be multiplied by constants and added together, and the result is again a valid quantum state. Such a combination is known as a superposition of  and .[33][34]\nA two-dimensional vector mathematically represents a qubit state. Physicists typically use bra–ket notation for quantum mechanical linear algebra, writing  'ket psi' for a vector labeled . Because a qubit is a two-state system, any qubit state takes the form , where  and  are the standard basis states,[a] and  and  are the probability amplitudes, which are in general complex numbers.[34] If either  or  is zero, the qubit is effectively a classical bit; when both are nonzero, the qubit is in superposition. Such a quantum state vector behaves similarly to a (classical) probability vector, with one key difference: unlike probabilities, probability amplitudes are not necessarily positive numbers.[36] Negative amplitudes allow for destructive wave interference.\nWhen a qubit is measured in the standard basis, the result is a classical bit. The Born rule describes the norm-squared correspondence between amplitudes and probabilities—when measuring a qubit , the state collapses to  with probability , or to  with probability .\nAny valid qubit state has coefficients  and  such that .\nAs an example, measuring the qubit  would produce either  or  with equal probability.\nEach additional qubit doubles the dimension of the state space.[35]\nAs an example, the vector ⁠1/√2⁠|00⟩ + ⁠1/√2⁠|01⟩ represents a two-qubit state, a tensor product of the qubit |0⟩ with the qubit ⁠1/√2⁠|0⟩ + ⁠1/√2⁠|1⟩.\nThis vector inhabits a four-dimensional vector space spanned by the basis vectors |00⟩, |01⟩, |10⟩, and |11⟩.\nThe Bell state ⁠1/√2⁠|00⟩ + ⁠1/√2⁠|11⟩ is impossible to decompose into the tensor product of two individual qubits—the two qubits are entangled because neither qubit has a state vector of its own.\nIn general, the vector space for an n-qubit system is 2n-dimensional, and this makes it challenging for a classical computer to simulate a quantum one: representing a 100-qubit system requires storing 2100 classical values.\n\n\n\nThe state of this one-qubit quantum memory can be manipulated by applying quantum logic gates, analogous to how classical memory can be manipulated with classical logic gates. One important gate for both classical and quantum computation is the NOT gate, which can be represented by a matrix\n\nMathematically, the application of such a logic gate to a quantum state vector is modeled with matrix multiplication. Thus\n\n and .\nThe mathematics of single-qubit gates can be extended to operate on multi-qubit quantum memories in two important ways. One way is simply to select a qubit and apply that gate to the target qubit while leaving the remainder of the memory unaffected. Another way is to apply the gate to its target only if another part of the memory is in a desired state. These two choices can be illustrated using another example. The possible states of a two-qubit quantum memory are\n\nThe controlled NOT (CNOT) gate can then be represented using the following matrix:\n\nAs a mathematical consequence of this definition, , , , and . In other words, the CNOT applies a NOT gate ( from before) to the second qubit if and only if the first qubit is in the state . If the first qubit is , nothing is done to either qubit.\nIn summary, quantum computation can be described as a network of quantum logic gates and measurements. However, any measurement can be deferred to the end of quantum computation, though this deferment may come at a computational cost, so most quantum circuits depict a network consisting only of quantum logic gates and no measurements.\n\nQuantum parallelism[edit]\nQuantum parallelism is the heuristic that quantum computers can be thought of as evaluating a function for multiple input values simultaneously. This can be achieved by preparing a quantum system in a superposition of input states and applying a unitary transformation that encodes the function to be evaluated. The resulting state encodes the function's output values for all input values in the superposition, enabling the simultaneous computation of multiple outputs. This property is key to the speedup of many quantum algorithms. However, \"parallelism\" in this sense is insufficient to speed up a computation, because the measurement at the end of the computation gives only one value. To be useful, a quantum algorithm must also incorporate some other conceptual ingredient.[37][38]\n\nQuantum programming[edit]\n\nThere are multiple models of computation for quantum computing, distinguished by the basic elements in which the computation is decomposed.\n\n\nA quantum circuit diagram implementing a Toffoli gate from more primitive gates\nA quantum gate array decomposes computation into a sequence of few-qubit quantum gates. A quantum computation can be described as a network of quantum logic gates and measurements. However, any measurement can be deferred to the end of quantum computation, though this deferment may come at a computational cost, so most quantum circuits depict a network consisting only of quantum logic gates and no measurements.\nAny quantum computation (which is, in the above formalism, any unitary matrix of size  over  qubits) can be represented as a network of quantum logic gates from a fairly small family of gates. A choice of gate family that enables this construction is known as a universal gate set, since a computer that can run such circuits is a universal quantum computer. One common such set includes all single-qubit gates as well as the CNOT gate from above. This means any quantum computation can be performed by executing a sequence of single-qubit gates together with CNOT gates. Though this gate set is infinite, it can be replaced with a finite gate set by appealing to the Solovay-Kitaev theorem. Implementation of Boolean functions using the few-qubit quantum gates is presented here.[39]\n\nMeasurement-based quantum computing[edit]\nA measurement-based quantum computer decomposes computation into a sequence of Bell state measurements and single-qubit quantum gates applied to a highly entangled initial state (a cluster state), using a technique called quantum gate teleportation.\n\nAdiabatic quantum computing[edit]\nAn adiabatic quantum computer, based on quantum annealing, decomposes computation into a slow continuous transformation of an initial Hamiltonian into a final Hamiltonian, whose ground states contain the solution.[40]\n\nNeuromorphic quantum computing[edit]\nNeuromorphic quantum computing (abbreviated 'n.quantum computing') is an unconventional process of computing that uses neuromorphic computing to perform quantum operations. It was suggested that quantum algorithms, which are algorithms that run on a realistic model of quantum computation, can be computed equally efficiently with neuromorphic quantum computing. Both traditional quantum computing and neuromorphic quantum computing are physics-based unconventional computing approaches to computations and do not follow the von Neumann architecture. They both construct a system (a circuit) that represents the physical problem at hand and then leverage their respective physics properties of the system to seek the \"minimum\". Neuromorphic quantum computing and quantum computing share similar physical properties during computation.\n\nTopological quantum computing[edit]\nA topological quantum computer decomposes computation into the braiding of anyons in a 2D lattice.[41]\n\nQuantum Turing machine[edit]\nA quantum Turing machine is the quantum analog of a Turing machine.[8] All of these models of computation—quantum circuits,[42] one-way quantum computation,[43] adiabatic quantum computation,[44] and topological quantum computation[45]—have been shown to be equivalent to the quantum Turing machine; given a perfect implementation of one such quantum computer, it can simulate all the others with no more than polynomial overhead. This equivalence need not hold for practical quantum computers, since the overhead of simulation may be too large to be practical.\n\nNoisy intermediate-scale quantum computing[edit]\nThe threshold theorem shows how increasing the number of qubits can mitigate errors,[46] yet fully fault-tolerant quantum computing remains \"a rather distant dream\".[47] According to some researchers, noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) machines may have specialized uses in the near future, but noise in quantum gates limits their reliability.[47]\nScientists at Harvard University successfully created \"quantum circuits\" that correct errors more efficiently than alternative methods, which may potentially remove a major obstacle to practical quantum computers.[48] The Harvard research team was supported by MIT, QuEra Computing, Caltech, and Princeton University and funded by DARPA's Optimization with Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum devices (ONISQ) program.[49][50]\n\nQuantum cryptography and cybersecurity[edit]\n\nDigital cryptography enables communications to remain private, preventing unauthorized parties from accessing them. Conventional encryption, the obscuring of a message with a key through an algorithm, relies on the algorithm being difficult to reverse. Encryption is also the basis for digital signatures and authentication mechanisms. Quantum computing may be sufficiently more powerful that difficult reversals are feasible, allowing messages relying on conventional encryption to be read.[51]\nQuantum cryptography replaces conventional algorithms with computations based on quantum computing. In principle, quantum encryption would be impossible to decode even with a quantum computer. This advantage comes at a significant cost in terms of elaborate infrastructure, while effectively preventing legitimate decoding of messages by governmental security officials.[51]\nOngoing research in quantum and post-quantum cryptography has led to new algorithms for quantum key distribution, initial work on quantum random number generation and to some early technology demonstrations.[52]: 1012–1036 \n\n\n\nQuantum cryptography enables new ways to transmit data securely; for example, quantum key distribution uses entangled quantum states to establish secure cryptographic keys.[52]: 1017  When a sender and receiver exchange quantum states, they can guarantee that an adversary does not intercept the message, as any unauthorized eavesdropper would disturb the delicate quantum system and introduce a detectable change.[53] With appropriate cryptographic protocols, the sender and receiver can thus establish shared private information resistant to eavesdropping.[13][54]\nModern fiber-optic cables can transmit quantum information over relatively short distances. Ongoing experimental research aims to develop more reliable hardware (such as quantum repeaters), hoping to scale this technology to long-distance quantum networks with end-to-end entanglement. Theoretically, this could enable novel technological applications, such as distributed quantum computing and enhanced quantum sensing.[55][56]\n\n\nProgress in finding quantum algorithms typically focuses on this quantum circuit model, though exceptions like the quantum adiabatic algorithm exist. Quantum algorithms can be roughly categorized by the type of speedup achieved over corresponding classical algorithms.[57]\nQuantum algorithms that offer more than a polynomial speedup over the best-known classical algorithm include Shor's algorithm for factoring and the related quantum algorithms for computing discrete logarithms, solving Pell's equation, and, more generally, solving the hidden subgroup problem for abelian finite groups.[57] These algorithms depend on the primitive of the quantum Fourier transform. No mathematical proof has been found that shows that an equally fast classical algorithm cannot be discovered, but evidence suggests that this is unlikely.[58] Certain oracle problems like Simon's problem and the Bernstein–Vazirani problem do give provable speedups, though this is in the quantum query model, which is a restricted model where lower bounds are much easier to prove and don't necessarily translate to speedups for practical problems.\nOther problems, including the simulation of quantum physical processes from chemistry and solid-state physics, the approximation of certain Jones polynomials, and the quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations, have quantum algorithms appearing to give super-polynomial speedups and are BQP-complete. Because these problems are BQP-complete, an equally fast classical algorithm for them would imply that \"no quantum algorithm\" provides a super-polynomial speedup, which is believed to be unlikely.[59]\nIn addition to these problems, quantum algorithms are being explored for applications in cryptography, optimization, and machine learning, although most of these remain at the research stage and require significant advances in error correction and hardware scalability before practical implementation.[60]\nSome quantum algorithms, such as Grover's algorithm and amplitude amplification, give polynomial speedups over corresponding classical algorithms.[57] Though these algorithms give comparably modest quadratic speedup, they are widely applicable and thus give speedups for a wide range of problems.[21] These speed-ups are, however, over the theoretical worst-case of classical algorithms, and concrete real-world speed-ups over algorithms used in practice have not been demonstrated.\n\nSimulation of quantum systems[edit]\n\nSince chemistry and nanotechnology rely on understanding quantum systems, and such systems are impossible to simulate in an efficient manner classically, quantum simulation may be an important application of quantum computing.[61] Quantum simulation could also be used to simulate the behavior of atoms and particles at unusual conditions such as the reactions inside a collider.[62] In June 2023, IBM computer scientists reported that a quantum computer produced better results for a physics problem than a conventional supercomputer.[63][64]\nAbout 2% of the annual global energy output is used for nitrogen fixation to produce ammonia for the Haber process in the agricultural fertiliser industry (even though naturally occurring organisms also produce ammonia). Quantum simulations might be used to understand this process and increase the energy efficiency of production.[65] It is expected that an early use of quantum computing will be modeling that improves the efficiency of the Haber–Bosch process[66] by the mid-2020s[67] although some have predicted it will take longer.[68]\n\nPost-quantum cryptography[edit]\n\nA notable application of quantum computing is in attacking cryptographic systems that are currently in use. Integer factorization, which underpins the security of public key cryptographic systems, is believed to be computationally infeasible on a classical computer for large integers if they are the product of a few prime numbers (e.g., the product of two 300-digit primes).[69] By contrast, a quantum computer could solve this problem exponentially faster using Shor's algorithm to factor the integer.[70] This ability would allow a quantum computer to break many of the cryptographic systems in use today, in the sense that there would be a polynomial time (in the number of digits of the integer) algorithm for solving the problem. In particular, most of the popular public key ciphers are based on the difficulty of factoring integers or the discrete logarithm problem, both of which can be solved by Shor's algorithm. In particular, the RSA, Diffie–Hellman, and elliptic curve Diffie–Hellman algorithms could be broken. These are used to protect secure Web pages, encrypted email, and many other types of data. Breaking these would have significant ramifications for electronic privacy and security.\nIdentifying cryptographic systems that may be secure against quantum algorithms is an actively researched topic under the field of post-quantum cryptography.[71][72] Some public-key algorithms are based on problems other than the integer factorization and discrete logarithm problems to which Shor's algorithm applies, such as the McEliece cryptosystem, which relies on a hard problem in coding theory.[71][73] Lattice-based cryptosystems are also not known to be broken by quantum computers, and finding a polynomial time algorithm for solving the dihedral hidden subgroup problem, which would break many lattice-based cryptosystems, is a well-studied open problem.[74] It has been shown that applying Grover's algorithm to break a symmetric (secret-key) algorithm by brute force requires time equal to roughly 2n/2 invocations of the underlying cryptographic algorithm, compared with roughly 2n in the classical case,[75] meaning that symmetric key lengths are effectively halved: AES-256 would have comparable security against an attack using Grover's algorithm to that AES-128 has against classical brute-force search (see Key size).\n\n\n\nThe most well-known example of a problem that allows for a polynomial quantum speedup is unstructured search, which involves finding a marked item out of a list of  items in a database. This can be solved by Grover's algorithm using  queries to the database, quadratically fewer than the  queries required for classical algorithms. In this case, the advantage is not only provable but also optimal: it has been shown that Grover's algorithm gives the maximal possible probability of finding the desired element for any number of oracle lookups. Many examples of provable quantum speedups for query problems are based on Grover's algorithm, including Brassard, Høyer, and Tapp's algorithm for finding collisions in two-to-one functions,[76] and Farhi, Goldstone, and Gutmann's algorithm for evaluating NAND trees.[77]\nProblems that can be efficiently addressed with Grover's algorithm have the following properties:[78][79]\n\nThere is no searchable structure in the collection of possible answers,\nThe number of possible answers to check is the same as the number of inputs to the algorithm, and\nThere exists a Boolean function that evaluates each input and determines whether it is the correct answer.\nFor problems with all these properties, the running time of Grover's algorithm on a quantum computer scales as the square root of the number of inputs (or elements in the database), as opposed to the linear scaling of classical algorithms. A general class of problems to which Grover's algorithm can be applied[80] is a Boolean satisfiability problem, where the database through which the algorithm iterates is that of all possible answers. An example and possible application of this is a password cracker that attempts to guess a password. Breaking symmetric ciphers with this algorithm is of interest to government agencies.[81]\n\n\nQuantum annealing relies on the adiabatic theorem to undertake calculations. A system is placed in the ground state for a simple Hamiltonian, which slowly evolves to a more complicated Hamiltonian whose ground state represents the solution to the problem in question. The adiabatic theorem states that if the evolution is slow enough, the system will stay in its ground state at all times through the process. Quantum annealing can solve Ising models and the (computationally equivalent) QUBO problem, which in turn can be used to encode a wide range of combinatorial optimization problems.[82] Adiabatic optimization may be helpful for solving computational biology problems.[83]\n\n\n\nSince quantum computers can produce outputs that classical computers cannot produce efficiently, and since quantum computation is fundamentally linear algebraic, some express hope in developing quantum algorithms that can speed up machine learning tasks.[47][84]\nFor example, the HHL Algorithm, named after its discoverers Harrow, Hassidim, and Lloyd, is believed to provide speedup over classical counterparts.[47][85] Some research groups have recently explored the use of quantum annealing hardware for training Boltzmann machines and deep neural networks.[86][87][88]\n\nDeep generative chemistry models emerge as powerful tools to expedite drug discovery. However, the immense size and complexity of the structural space of all possible drug-like molecules pose significant obstacles, which could be overcome in the future by quantum computers. Quantum computers are naturally good for solving complex quantum many-body problems[22] and thus may be instrumental in applications involving quantum chemistry. Therefore, one can expect that quantum-enhanced generative models[89] including quantum GANs[90] may eventually be developed into ultimate generative chemistry algorithms.\n\n\nA wafer of adiabatic quantum computers\nAs of 2023, classical computers outperform quantum computers for all real-world applications. While current quantum computers may speed up solutions to particular mathematical problems, they give no computational advantage for practical tasks. Scientists and engineers are exploring multiple technologies for quantum computing hardware and hope to develop scalable quantum architectures, but serious obstacles remain.[91][92]\n\n\nThere are a number of technical challenges in building a large-scale quantum computer.[93] Physicist David DiVincenzo has listed these requirements for a practical quantum computer:[94]\n\nPhysically scalable to increase the number of qubits\nQubits that can be initialized to arbitrary values\nQuantum gates that are faster than decoherence time\nUniversal gate set\nQubits that can be read easily.\nSourcing parts for quantum computers is also very difficult. Superconducting quantum computers, like those constructed by Google and IBM, need helium-3, a nuclear research byproduct, and special superconducting cables made only by the Japanese company Coax Co.[95]\nThe control of multi-qubit systems requires the generation and coordination of a large number of electrical signals with tight and deterministic timing resolution. This has led to the development of quantum controllers that enable interfacing with the qubits. Scaling these systems to support a growing number of qubits is an additional challenge.[96]\n\n\nOne of the greatest challenges involved in constructing quantum computers is controlling or removing quantum decoherence. This usually means isolating the system from its environment, as interactions with the external world cause the system to decohere. However, other sources of decoherence also exist. Examples include the quantum gates, the lattice vibrations, and the background thermonuclear spin of the physical system used to implement the qubits. Decoherence is irreversible, as it is effectively non-unitary, and is usually something that should be highly controlled, if not avoided. Decoherence times for candidate systems in particular, the transverse relaxation time T2 (for NMR and MRI technology, also called the dephasing time), typically range between nanoseconds and seconds at low temperatures.[97] Currently, some quantum computers require their qubits to be cooled to 20 millikelvin (usually using a dilution refrigerator[98]) in order to prevent significant decoherence.[99] A 2020 study argues that ionizing radiation such as cosmic rays can nevertheless cause certain systems to decohere within milliseconds.[100]\nAs a result, time-consuming tasks may render some quantum algorithms inoperable, as attempting to maintain the state of qubits for a long enough duration will eventually corrupt the superpositions.[101]\nThese issues are more difficult for optical approaches as the timescales are orders of magnitude shorter, and an often-cited approach to overcoming them is optical pulse shaping. Error rates are typically proportional to the ratio of operating time to decoherence time; hence, any operation must be completed much more quickly than the decoherence time.\nAs described by the threshold theorem, if the error rate is small enough, it is thought to be possible to use quantum error correction to suppress errors and decoherence. This allows the total calculation time to be longer than the decoherence time if the error correction scheme can correct errors faster than decoherence introduces them. An often-cited figure for the required error rate in each gate for fault-tolerant computation is 10−3, assuming the noise is depolarizing.\nMeeting this scalability condition is possible for a wide range of systems. However, the use of error correction brings with it the cost of a greatly increased number of required qubits. The number required to factor integers using Shor's algorithm is still polynomial, and thought to be between L and L2, where L is the number of binary digits in the number to be factored; error correction algorithms would inflate this figure by an additional factor of L. For a 1000-bit number, this implies a need for about 104 bits without error correction.[102] With error correction, the figure would rise to about 107 bits. Computation time is about L2 or about 107 steps and at 1 MHz, about 10 seconds. However, the encoding and error-correction overheads increase the size of a real fault-tolerant quantum computer by several orders of magnitude. Careful estimates[103][104] show that at least 3 million physical qubits would factor 2,048-bit integer in 5 months on a fully error-corrected trapped-ion quantum computer. In terms of the number of physical qubits, to date, this remains the lowest estimate[105] for practically useful integer factorization problem sizing 1,024-bit or larger. \nOne approach to overcoming errors combines low-density parity-check code with cat qubits that have intrinsic bit-flip error suppression. Implementing 100 logical qubits with 768 cat qubits could reduce the error rate to one part in 108 per cycle per bit.[106]\nAnother approach to the stability-decoherence problem is to create a topological quantum computer with anyons, quasi-particles used as threads, and relying on braid theory to form stable logic gates.[107][108] Non-Abelian anyons can, in effect, remember how they have been manipulated, making them potentially useful in quantum computing.[109] As of 2025, Microsoft and other organizations are investing in quasi-particle research.[109]\n\n\nPhysicist John Preskill coined the term quantum supremacy to describe the engineering feat of demonstrating that a programmable quantum device can solve a problem beyond the capabilities of state-of-the-art classical computers.[110][47][111] The problem need not be useful, so some view the quantum supremacy test only as a potential future benchmark.[112]\nIn October 2019, Google AI Quantum, with the help of NASA, became the first to claim to have achieved quantum supremacy by performing calculations on the Sycamore quantum computer more than 3,000,000 times faster than they could be done on Summit, generally considered the world's fastest computer.[28][113][114] This claim has been subsequently challenged: IBM has stated that Summit can perform samples much faster than claimed,[115][116] and researchers have since developed better algorithms for the sampling problem used to claim quantum supremacy, giving substantial reductions to the gap between Sycamore and classical supercomputers[117][118][119] and even beating it.[120][121][122]\nIn December 2020, a group at USTC implemented a type of Boson sampling on 76 photons with a photonic quantum computer, Jiuzhang, to demonstrate quantum supremacy.[123][124][125] The authors claim that a classical contemporary supercomputer would require a computational time of 600 million years to generate the number of samples their quantum processor can generate in 20 seconds.[126]\nClaims of quantum supremacy have generated hype around quantum computing,[127] but they are based on contrived benchmark tasks that do not directly imply useful real-world applications.[91][128]\nIn January 2024, a study published in Physical Review Letters provided direct verification of quantum supremacy experiments by computing exact amplitudes for experimentally generated bitstrings using a new-generation Sunway supercomputer, demonstrating a significant leap in simulation capability built on a multiple-amplitude tensor network contraction algorithm. This development underscores the evolving landscape of quantum computing, highlighting both the progress and the complexities involved in validating quantum supremacy claims.[129]\n\n\nDespite high hopes for quantum computing, significant progress in hardware, and optimism about future applications, a 2023 Nature spotlight article summarized current quantum computers as being \"For now, [good for] absolutely nothing\".[91] The article elaborated that quantum computers are yet to be more useful or efficient than conventional computers in any case, though it also argued that, in the long term, such computers are likely to be useful. A 2023 Communications of the ACM article[92] found that current quantum computing algorithms are \"insufficient for practical quantum advantage without significant improvements across the software/hardware stack\". It argues that the most promising candidates for achieving speedup with quantum computers are \"small-data problems\", for example, in chemistry and materials science. However, the article also concludes that a large range of the potential applications it considered, such as machine learning, \"will not achieve quantum advantage with current quantum algorithms in the foreseeable future\", and it identified I/O constraints that make speedup unlikely for \"big data problems, unstructured linear systems, and database search based on Grover's algorithm\".\nThis state of affairs can be traced to several current and long-term considerations.\n\nConventional computer hardware and algorithms are not only optimized for practical tasks, but are still improving rapidly, particularly GPU accelerators.\nCurrent quantum computing hardware generates only a limited amount of entanglement before getting overwhelmed by noise.\nQuantum algorithms provide speedup over conventional algorithms only for some tasks, and matching these tasks with practical applications proved challenging. Some promising tasks and applications require resources far beyond those available today.[130][131] In particular, processing large amounts of non-quantum data is a challenge for quantum computers.[92]\nSome promising algorithms have been \"dequantized\", i.e., their non-quantum analogues with similar complexity have been found.\nIf quantum error correction is used to scale quantum computers to practical applications, its overhead may undermine the speedup offered by many quantum algorithms.[92]\nComplexity analysis of algorithms sometimes makes abstract assumptions that do not hold in applications. For example, input data may not already be available encoded in quantum states, and \"oracle functions\" used in Grover's algorithm often have internal structure that can be exploited for faster algorithms.\nIn particular, building computers with large numbers of qubits may be futile if those qubits are not connected well enough and cannot maintain a sufficiently high degree of entanglement for a long time. When trying to outperform conventional computers, quantum computing researchers often look for new tasks that can be solved on quantum computers, but this leaves the possibility that efficient non-quantum techniques will be developed in response, as seen for Quantum supremacy demonstrations. Therefore, it is desirable to prove lower bounds on the complexity of best possible non-quantum algorithms (which may be unknown) and show that some quantum algorithms asymptotically improve upon those bounds.\nBill Unruh doubted the practicality of quantum computers in a paper published in 1994.[132] Paul Davies argued that a 400-qubit computer would even come into conflict with the cosmological information bound implied by the holographic principle.[133] Skeptics like Gil Kalai doubt that quantum supremacy will ever be achieved.[134][135][136] Physicist Mikhail Dyakonov has expressed skepticism of quantum computing as follows:\n\n\"So the number of continuous parameters describing the state of such a useful quantum computer at any given moment must be... about 10300... Could we ever learn to control the more than 10300 continuously variable parameters defining the quantum state of such a system? My answer is simple. No, never.\"[137]\nPhysical realizations[edit]\n\nQuantum System One, a quantum computer by IBM from 2019 with 20 superconducting qubits[138]\nA practical quantum computer must use a physical system as a programmable quantum register.[139] Researchers are exploring several technologies as candidates for reliable qubit implementations.[140] Superconductors and trapped ions are some of the most developed proposals, but experimentalists are considering other hardware possibilities as well.[141]\nFor example, topological quantum computer approaches are being explored for more fault-tolerance computing systems.[142]\nThe first quantum logic gates were implemented with trapped ions and prototype general-purpose machines with up to 20 qubits have been realized. However, the technology behind these devices combines complex vacuum equipment, lasers, and microwave and radio frequency equipment, making full-scale processors difficult to integrate with standard computing equipment. Moreover, the trapped ion system itself has engineering challenges to overcome.[143]\nThe largest commercial systems are based on superconductor devices and have scaled to 2000 qubits. However, the error rates for larger machines have been on the order of 5%. Technologically, these devices are all cryogenic and scaling to large numbers of qubits requires wafer-scale integration, a serious engineering challenge by itself.[144]\n\nPotential applications[edit]\nWith focus on business management's point of view, the potential applications of quantum computing into four major categories are cybersecurity, data analytics and artificial intelligence, optimization and simulation, and data management and searching.[145]\nOther applications include healthcare (i.e., drug discovery), financial modeling, and natural language processing.[146]\n\n\n\n\nAny computational problem solvable by a classical computer is also solvable by a quantum computer.[147] Intuitively, this is because it is believed that all physical phenomena, including the operation of classical computers, can be described using quantum mechanics, which underlies the operation of quantum computers.\nConversely, any problem solvable by a quantum computer is also solvable by a classical computer. It is possible to simulate both quantum and classical computers manually with just some paper and a pen, if given enough time. More formally, any quantum computer can be simulated by a Turing machine. In other words, quantum computers provide no additional power over classical computers in terms of computability. This means that quantum computers cannot solve undecidable problems like the halting problem, and the existence of quantum computers does not disprove the Church–Turing thesis.[148]\n\n\n\nWhile quantum computers cannot solve any problems that classical computers cannot already solve, it is suspected that they can solve certain problems faster than classical computers. For instance, it is known that quantum computers can efficiently factor integers, while this is not believed to be the case for classical computers.\nThe class of problems that can be efficiently solved by a quantum computer with bounded error is called BQP, for \"bounded error, quantum, polynomial time\". More formally, BQP is the class of problems that can be solved by a polynomial-time quantum Turing machine with an error probability of at most 1/3. As a class of probabilistic problems, BQP is the quantum counterpart to BPP (\"bounded error, probabilistic, polynomial time\"), the class of problems that can be solved by polynomial-time probabilistic Turing machines with bounded error.[149] It is known that  and is widely suspected that , which intuitively would mean that quantum computers are more powerful than classical computers in terms of time complexity.[150]\n\nThe suspected relationship of BQP to several classical complexity classes[59]\nThe exact relationship of BQP to P, NP, and PSPACE is not known. However, it is known that ; that is, all problems that can be efficiently solved by a deterministic classical computer can also be efficiently solved by a quantum computer, and all problems that can be efficiently solved by a quantum computer can also be solved by a deterministic classical computer with polynomial space resources. It is further suspected that BQP is a strict superset of P, meaning that there exist problems that are efficiently solvable by quantum computers that are not efficiently solvable by deterministic classical computers. For instance, integer factorization and the discrete logarithm problem are known to be in BQP and are suspected to be outside of P. On the relationship of BQP to NP, little is known beyond the fact that some NP problems that are believed not to be in P are also in BQP (integer factorization and the discrete logarithm problem are both in NP, for example). It is suspected that ; that is, it is believed that there are efficiently checkable problems that are not efficiently solvable by a quantum computer. As a direct consequence of this belief, it is also suspected that BQP is disjoint from the class of NP-complete problems (if an NP-complete problem were in BQP, then it would follow from NP-hardness that all problems in NP are in BQP).[151]\n\n\n\n\nD-Wave Systems – Quantum computing company\nElectronic quantum holography – Information storage technology\nGlossary of quantum computing\nIntelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity – American government agency\nIndia's quantum computer – Indian proposed quantum computer\nQpiAI-Indus – India's first full stack quantum computer\nIonQ – US information technology company\nList of emerging technologies – New technologies actively in development\nList of quantum computing journals\nList of quantum processors\nMagic state distillation – Quantum computing algorithm\nMetacomputing – Computing for the purpose of computing\nNatural computing – Methods that imitate, replicate or use natural processes\nNon-local quantum computation – Method of quantum computing via entanglement\nOptical computing – Computer that uses photons or light waves\nQuantum bus – Device to store or transfer information in quantum computing\nQuantum cognition – Application of quantum theory mathematics to cognitive phenomena\nQuantum sensor – Device measuring quantum mechanical effects\nQuantum volume – Metric for a quantum computer's capabilities\nQuantum weirdness – Unintuitive aspects of quantum mechanics\nRigetti Computing – American quantum computing company\nSupercomputer – Type of extremely powerful computer\nTheoretical computer science – Subfield of computer science and mathematics\nUnconventional computing – Computing by new or unusual methods\nValleytronics – Experimental area in semiconductors\n\n\n\n^ The standard basis is also the computational basis.[35]\n\n\n\n\n^ Mermin 2007, p. 1.\n\n^ Aaronson 2013, p. 132.\n\n^ Zwiebach, Barton (2022).

Neurons can be either biological cells or mathematical models. While individual neurons are simple, many of them together in a network can perform complex tasks. There are two main types of neural networks.\n\nIn neuroscience, a biological neural network is a physical structure found in brains and complex nervous systems – a population of nerve cells connected by synapses.\nIn machine learning, an artificial neural network is a mathematical model used to approximate nonlinear functions. Artificial neural networks are used to solve artificial intelligence problems.\n\n\nAnimated confocal micrograph of part of a biological neural network in a mouse's striatum\n\nIn the context of biology, a neural network is a population of biological neurons chemically connected to each other by synapses. A given neuron can be connected to hundreds of thousands of synapses.[1]\nEach neuron sends and receives electrochemical signals called action potentials to its connected neighbors. A neuron can serve an excitatory role, amplifying and propagating signals it receives, or an inhibitory role, suppressing signals instead.[1]\nPopulations of interconnected neurons that are smaller than neural networks are called neural circuits. Very large interconnected networks are called large scale brain networks, and many of these together form brains and nervous systems.\nSignals generated by neural networks in the brain eventually travel through the nervous system and across neuromuscular junctions to muscle cells, where they cause contraction and thereby motion.[2]\n\nIn machine learning[edit]\n\nSchematic of a simple feedforward artificial neural network\nIn machine learning, a neural network is an artificial mathematical model used to approximate nonlinear functions. While early artificial neural networks were physical machines,[3] today they are almost always implemented in software.\nNeurons in an artificial neural network are usually arranged into layers, with information passing from the first layer (the input layer) through one or more intermediate layers (the hidden layers) to the final layer (the output layer).[4]\nThe \"signal\" input to each neuron is a number, specifically a linear combination of the outputs of the connected neurons in the previous layer. The signal each neuron outputs is calculated from this number, according to its activation function. The behavior of the network depends on the strengths (or weights) of the connections between neurons. A network is trained by modifying these weights through empirical risk minimization or backpropagation in order to fit some preexisting dataset.[5]\nThe term deep neural network refers to neural networks that have more than three layers, typically including at least two hidden layers in addition to the input and output layers.\nNeural networks are used to solve problems in artificial intelligence, and have thereby found applications in many disciplines, including predictive modeling, adaptive control, facial recognition, handwriting recognition, general game playing, and generative AI.\n\n\n\nThe theoretical base for contemporary neural networks was independently proposed by Alexander Bain in 1873[6] and William James in 1890.[7] Both posited that human thought emerged from interactions among large numbers of neurons inside the brain. In 1949, Donald Hebb described Hebbian learning, the idea that neural networks can change and learn over time by strengthening a synapse every time a signal travels along it.[8] In 1956, Svaetichin discovered the functioning of second order retinal cells (Horizontal Cells), which were fundamental for the understanding of neural networks.\nArtificial neural networks were originally used to model biological neural networks starting in the 1930s under the approach of connectionism. However, starting with the invention of the perceptron, a simple artificial neural network, by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts in 1943,[9] followed by the implementation of one in hardware by Frank Rosenblatt in 1957,[3]\nartificial neural networks became increasingly used for machine learning applications instead, and increasingly different from their biological counterparts.\n\n\nEmergence\nBiological cybernetics\nBiologically-inspired computing\n\n\n^ a b \nShao, Feng; Shen, Zheng (January 9, 2022). \"How can artificial neural networks approximate the brain?\".

    "content": "This article is about the modern programming language for .NET. For the original Visual Basic, the last version of which was Visual Basic 6.0, see Visual Basic (classic).\n\nVisual BasicParadigmMulti-paradigm: structured, imperative, object-oriented, declarative, generic, reflective and event-drivenDesigned byMicrosoftDeveloperMicrosoftFirst appeared2001; 24 years agoStable release16.9[1] \n   / 2 March 2024; 21 months agoTyping disciplineStatic, both strong and weak,[2]  both safe and unsafe,[2] nominativePlatform.NET Framework, Mono, .NET[3][4]OSChiefly WindowsAlso on Android, BSD, iOS, Linux, macOS, Solaris, and UnixLicenseRoslyn compiler: MIT License[5]Filename extensions.vbWebsitedocs.microsoft.com/dotnet/visual-basic/Major implementations.NET Framework SDK, Roslyn Compiler and MonoDialectsMicrosoft Visual BasicInfluenced byClassic Visual BasicInfluencedSmall Basic, Mercury\nVisual Basic (VB), originally called Visual Basic .NET (VB.NET), is a multi-paradigm, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft and implemented on .NET, Mono, and the .NET Framework. Microsoft launched VB.NET in 2002 as the successor to its original Visual Basic language, the last version of which was Visual Basic 6.0. Although the \".NET\" portion of the name was dropped in 2005, this article uses \"Visual Basic [.NET]\" to refer to all Visual Basic languages released since 2002, in order to distinguish between them and the classic Visual Basic. Along with C# and F#, it is one of the three main languages targeting the .NET ecosystem. Microsoft updated its VB language strategy on 6 February 2023, stating that VB is a stable language now and Microsoft will keep maintaining it.[6]\nMicrosoft's integrated development environment (IDE) for developing in Visual Basic is Visual Studio. Most Visual Studio editions are commercial; the only exceptions are Visual Studio Express and Visual Studio Community, which are freeware. In addition, the .NET Framework SDK includes a freeware command-line compiler called vbc.exe. Mono also includes a command-line VB.NET compiler.\nVisual Basic is often used in conjunction with the Windows Forms GUI library to make desktop apps for Windows. Programming for Windows Forms with Visual Basic involves dragging and dropping controls on a form using a GUI designer and writing corresponding code for each control.\n\n\nUse in making GUI programs[edit]\n\nThe Windows Forms library is most commonly used to create GUI interfaces in Visual Basic. All visual elements in the Windows Forms class library derive from the Control class. This provides the minimal functionality of a user interface element such as location, size, color, font, text, as well as common events like click and drag/drop. The Control class also has docking support to let a control rearrange its position under its parent.\nForms are typically designed in the Visual Studio IDE. In Visual Studio, forms are created using drag-and-drop techniques. A tool is used to place controls (e.g., text boxes, buttons, etc.) on the form (window).  Controls have attributes and event handlers associated with them. Default values are provided when the control is created, but may be changed in the Visual Studio IDE GUI or in code.  Many attribute values can be modified during run time by code such as based on user actions, or changes in the environment, providing a dynamic application.  For example, code can be inserted into the form resize event handler to reposition a control so that it remains centered on the form, expands to fill up the form, etc. By inserting code into the event handler for a keypress in a text box, the program can automatically translate the case of the text being entered, or even prevent certain characters from being inserted.\n\n\nThis section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it.  (April 2014)\nVisual Basic uses statements to specify actions. The most common statement is an expression statement, consisting of an expression to be evaluated, on a single line. As part of that evaluation, functions or subroutines may be called and variables may be assigned new values. To modify the normal sequential execution of statements, Visual Basic provides several control-flow statements identified by reserved keywords. Structured programming is supported by several constructs including two conditional execution constructs (If ... Then ... Else ... End If and  Select Case ...  Case ...  End Select ) and four iterative execution (loop) constructs (Do ... Loop, For ... To, For Each, and While ... End While) . The For ... To statement has separate initialisation and testing sections, both of which must be present. (See examples below.) The For Each statement steps through each value in a list.\nIn addition, in Visual Basic:\n\nThere is no unified way of defining blocks of statements. Instead, certain keywords, such as \"If ... Then\" or \"Sub\" are interpreted as starters of sub-blocks of code and have matching termination keywords such as \"End If\" or \"End Sub\".\nStatements are terminated either with a colon (\":\") or with the end of line. Multiple-line statements in Visual Basic are enabled with \" _\" at the end of each such line.  The need for the underscore continuation character was largely removed in version 10 and later versions.[7]\nThe equals sign (\"=\") is used in both assigning values to variables and in comparison.\nRound brackets (parentheses) are used with arrays, both to declare them and to get a value at a given index in one of them. Visual Basic uses round brackets to define the parameters of subroutines or functions.\nA single quotation mark (') or the keyword REM, placed at the beginning of a line or after any number of space or tab characters at the beginning of a line, or after other code on a line, indicates that the (remainder of the) line is a comment.\n\nThe following is a very simple Visual Basic program, a version of the classic \"Hello, World!\" example created as a console application:\n\nModule Module1\n\n    Sub Main()\n        ' The classic \"Hello, World!\" demonstration program\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Hello, World!\")\n    End Sub\n\nEnd Module\n\nIt prints \"Hello, World!\" on a command-line window. Each line serves a specific purpose, as follows:\n\nModule Module1\n\nThis is a module definition. Modules are a division of code, which can contain any kind of object, like constants or variables, functions or methods, or classes, but can not be instantiated as objects like classes and cannot inherit from other modules. Modules serve as containers of code that can be referenced from other parts of a program.[8]It is common practice for a module and the code file which contains it to have the same name. However, this is not required, as a single code file may contain more than one module or class.\n\nSub Main()\n\nThis line defines a subroutine called \"Main\". \"Main\" is the entry point, where the program begins execution.[9]\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Hello, world!\")\n\nThis line performs the actual task of writing the output. Console is a system object, representing a command-line interface (also known as a \"console\") and granting programmatic access to the operating system's standard streams. The program calls the Console method WriteLine, which causes the string passed to it to be displayed on the console.\nInstead of Console.WriteLine, an alternative is MsgBox, which prints the message in a dialog box instead of a command-line window.[10]\n\n\nThis piece of code outputs Floyd's Triangle to the console:\n\nImports System.Console\n\nModule Program\n\n    Sub Main()\n        Dim rows As Integer\n\n        ' Input validation.\n        Do Until Integer.TryParse(ReadLine(\"Enter a value for how many rows to be displayed: \" & vbcrlf), rows) AndAlso rows >= 1\n            WriteLine(\"Allowed range is 1 and {0}\", Integer.MaxValue)\n        Loop\n      \n        ' Output of Floyd's Triangle\n        Dim current As Integer = 1\n        Dim row As Integer \n        Dim column As Integer\n        For row = 1 To rows\n            For column = 1 To row\n                Write(\"{0,-2} \", current)\n                current += 1\n            Next\n\n            WriteLine()\n        Next\n    End Sub\n\n    ''' <summary>\n    ''' Like Console.ReadLine but takes a prompt string.\n    ''' </summary>\n    Function ReadLine(Optional prompt As String = Nothing) As String\n        If prompt IsNot Nothing Then\n            Write(prompt)\n        End If\n\n        Return Console.ReadLine()\n    "

    "content": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\nIn software deployment, an environment or tier is a computer system or set of systems in which a computer program or software component is deployed and executed. In simple cases, such as developing and immediately executing a program on the same machine, there may be a single environment, but in industrial use, the development environment (where changes are originally made) and production environment (what end users use) are separated, often with several stages in between. This structured release management process allows phased deployment (rollout), testing, and rollback in case of problems. \nEnvironments may vary significantly in size: the development environment is typically an individual developer's workstation, while the production environment may be a network of many geographically distributed machines in data centers, or virtual machines in cloud computing. Code, data, and configuration may be deployed in parallel, and need not connect to the corresponding tier—for example, pre-production code might connect to a production database.\n\n\n\nDeployment architectures vary significantly, but, broadly, the tiers are bookended by starting at development (DEV) and ending at production (PROD). A common 4-tier architecture is development, testing, model, production (DEV, TEST, MODL, PROD), with software being deployed to each in order. Other common environments include Quality Control (QC), for acceptance testing; sandbox or experimental (EXP), for experiments that are not intended to  proceed to production; and Disaster Recovery, to provide an immediate fallback in case of problems with production. Another common architecture is development, testing, acceptance and production (DTAP).\nThis language is particularly suited for server programs, where servers run in a remote data center; for code that runs on an end user's device, such as applications (apps) or clients, one can refer to the user environment (USER) or local environment (LOCAL) instead.\nExact definitions and boundaries between environments vary – test may be considered part of dev, Acceptance may be considered part of test, part of stage, or be separate, etc. The main tiers are progressed through in order, with new releases being deployed (rolled out or pushed) to each in turn.[1][2] Experimental and recovery tiers, if present, are outside this flow – experimental releases are terminal, while recovery is typically an old or duplicate version of production, deployed after production. In case of problems, one can roll back to the old release, most simply by pushing the old release as if it were a new release. The last step, deploying to production (\"pushing to prod\") is the most sensitive, as any problems result in immediate user impact. For this  is often handled differently, at least being monitored more carefully, and in some cases having phased rollout or only requiring flipping a switch, allowing rapid rollback.  It is best to avoid a name like Quality Assurance (QA); QA  doesn’t mean software testing. Testing is important, but it is different from QA. \nSometimes deployment is done outside of this regular process, primarily to provide urgent or relatively minor changes, without requiring a full release. This may consist of a single patch, a large service pack, or a small hotfix.\nEnvironments can be of very different sizes: development is typically an individual developer's workstation (though there may be thousands of developers), while production may be many geographically distributed machines; test and QC may be small or large, depending on the resources devoted to these, and staging can range from a single machine (similar to canary) to an exact duplicate of production.\n\n\nThe table below describes a finely-divided list of tiers[citation needed].\n\n\n\n\nEnvironment / Tier Name\n\nDescription\n\n\nLocal\n\nDeveloper's desktop/workstation\n\n\nDevelopment / Trunk\n\nDevelopment server acting as a sandbox where unit testing may be performed by the developer\n\n\nIntegration\n\nCI build target, or for developer testing of side effects\n\n\nTesting / Test / QC / Internal acceptance\n\nThe environment where interface testing is performed. A quality control team ensures that the new code will not have any impact on the existing functionality and tests major functionalities of the system after deploying the new code in the test environment.\n\n\nStaging / Stage / Model / Pre-production / External-client acceptance / Demo\n\nMirror of production environment\n\n\nProduction / Live\n\nServes end-users/clients\n\n\n\n\nThe development environment (dev) is the environment in which changes to software are developed, most simply an individual developer's workstation. This differs from the ultimate target environment in various ways – the target may not be a desktop computer (it may be a smartphone, embedded system, headless machine in a data center, etc.), and even if otherwise similar, the developer's environment will include development tools like a compiler, integrated development environment, different or additional versions of libraries and support software, etc., which are not present in a user's environment.\nIn the context of revision control, particularly with multiple developers, finer distinctions are drawn: a developer has a working copy of source code on their machine, and changes are submitted to the repository, being committed either to the trunk or a branch, depending on development methodology. The environment on an individual workstation, in which changes are worked on and tried out, may be referred to as the local environment or a sandbox. Building the repository's copy of the source code in a clean environment is a separate step, part of integration (integrating disparate changes), and this environment may be called the integration environment or the development environment; in continuous integration this is done frequently, as often as for every revision. The source code level concept of \"committing a change to the repository\", followed by building the trunk or branch, corresponds to pushing to release from local (individual developer's environment) to integration (clean build); a bad release at this step means a change broke the build, and rolling back the release corresponds to either rolling back all changes from that point onward, or undoing just the breaking change, if possible.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the test environment is to allow human testers to exercise new and changed code via either automated checks or non-automated techniques. After the developer accepts the new code and configurations through unit testing in the development environment, the items are moved to one or more test environments.[3] Upon test failure, the test environment can remove the faulty code from the test platforms, contact the responsible developer, and provide detailed test and result logs. If all tests pass, the test environment or a continuous integration framework controlling the tests can automatically promote the code to the next deployment environment.\nDifferent types of testing suggest different types of test environments, some or all of which may be virtualized[4] to allow rapid, parallel testing to take place. For example, automated user interface tests[5] may occur across several virtual operating systems and displays (real or virtual). Performance tests may require a normalized physical baseline hardware configuration, so that performance test results can be compared over time. Availability or durability testing may depend on failure simulators in virtual hardware and virtual networks. \nTests may be serial (one after the other) or parallel (some or all at once) depending on the sophistication of the test environment. A significant goal for agile and other high-productivity software development practices is reducing the time from software design or specification to delivery in production.[6] Highly automated and parallelized test environments are important contributors to rapid software development.\n\n\nA stage, staging or pre-production environment is an environment for testing that exactly resembles a production environment.[7] It seeks to mirror an actual production environment as closely as possible and may connect to other production services and data, such as databases. For example, servers will be run on remote machines, rather than locally (as on a developer's workstation during dev, or on a single test machine during the test), which tests the effects of networking on the system.\nThe primary use of a staging environment is to test all the installation/configuration/migration scripts and procedures before they're applied to a production environment.  This ensures all major and minor upgrades to a production environment are completed reliably, without errors, and in a minimum of time.\nAnother important use of staging is performance testing, particularly load testing, as this is often sensitive to the environment.\nStaging is also used by some organizations to preview new features to select customers or to validate integrations with live versions of external dependencies.\n\n\n\nThe production environment is also known as live, particularly for servers, as it is the environment that users directly interact with.\nDeploying to production is the most sensitive step; it may be done by deploying new code directly (overwriting old code, so only one copy is present at a time), or by deploying a configuration change. This can take various forms: deploying a parallel installation of a new version of code, and switching between them with a configuration change; deploying a new version of code with the old behavior and a feature flag, and switching to the new behavior with a configuration change that performs a flag flip; or by deploying separate servers (one running the old code, one the new) and redirecting traffic from old to new with a configuration change at the traffic routing level. These in turn may be done all at once or gradually, in phases.\nDeploying a new release generally requires a restart, unless hot swapping is possible, and thus requires either an interruption in service (usual for user software, where applications are restarted), or redundancy – either restarting instances slowly behind a load balancer, or starting up new servers ahead of time and then simply redirecting traffic to the new servers.\nWhen deploying a new release to production, rather than immediately deploying to all instances or users, it may be deployed to a single instance or fraction of users first, and then either deployed to all or gradually deployed in phases, in order to catch any last-minute problems. This is similar to staging, except actually done in production, and is referred to as a canary release, by analogy with coal mining. This adds complexity due to multiple releases being run simultaneously, and is thus usually over quickly, to avoid compatibility problems.\n\nFrameworks integration[edit]\nDevelopment, Staging and Production are known and documented environment variables in ASP.NET Core. Depending on the defined variable, different code is executed and content rendered, and different security and debug settings are applied.[8]\n\n\nBlue–green deployment\nApplication lifecycle management\nDevelopment, testing, acceptance and production\nIntegrated development environment\nSoftware development\nDowntime\nHigh availability\n\n\n^ \"Traditional Development/Integration/Staging/Production Practice for Software Development\".

    "content": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nGraphs such as these are among the objects studied by discrete mathematics, for their interesting mathematical properties, their usefulness as models of real-world problems, and their importance in developing computer algorithms.\nDiscrete mathematics is the study of mathematical structures that can be considered \"discrete\" (in a way analogous to discrete variables, having a one-to-one correspondence (bijection) with natural numbers), rather than \"continuous\" (analogously to continuous functions). Objects studied in discrete mathematics include integers, graphs, and statements in logic.[1][2][3] By contrast, discrete mathematics excludes topics in \"continuous mathematics\" such as real numbers, calculus or Euclidean geometry. Discrete objects can often be enumerated by integers; more formally, discrete mathematics has been characterized as the branch of mathematics dealing with countable sets[4] (finite sets or sets with the same cardinality as the natural numbers). However, there is no exact definition of the term \"discrete mathematics\".[5]\nThe set of objects studied in discrete mathematics can be finite or infinite. The term finite mathematics is sometimes applied to parts of the field of discrete mathematics that deal with finite sets, particularly those areas relevant to business.\nResearch in discrete mathematics increased in the latter half of the twentieth century partly due to the development of digital computers which operate in \"discrete\" steps and store data in \"discrete\" bits. Concepts and notations from discrete mathematics are useful in studying and describing objects and problems in branches of computer science, such as computer algorithms, programming languages, cryptography, automated theorem proving, and software development. Conversely, computer implementations are significant in applying ideas from discrete mathematics to real-world problems.\nAlthough the main objects of study in discrete mathematics are discrete objects, analytic methods from \"continuous\" mathematics are often employed as well.\nIn university curricula, discrete mathematics appeared in the 1980s, initially as a computer science support course; its contents were somewhat haphazard at the time. The curriculum has thereafter developed in conjunction with efforts by ACM and MAA into a course that is basically intended to develop mathematical maturity in first-year students; therefore, it is nowadays a prerequisite for mathematics majors in some universities as well.[6][7] Some high-school-level discrete mathematics textbooks have appeared as well.[8] At this level, discrete mathematics is sometimes seen as a preparatory course, like precalculus in this respect.[9]\nThe Fulkerson Prize is awarded for outstanding papers in discrete mathematics.\n\n\n\n\nTheoretical computer science[edit]\n\nComplexity studies the time taken by algorithms, such as this sorting routine.\nComputational geometry applies computer algorithms to representations of geometrical objects.\nTheoretical computer science includes areas of discrete mathematics relevant to computing. It draws heavily on graph theory and mathematical logic. Included within theoretical computer science is the study of algorithms and data structures. Computability studies what can be computed in principle, and has close ties to logic, while complexity studies the time, space, and other resources taken by computations. Automata theory and formal language theory are closely related to computability. Petri nets and process algebras are used to model computer systems, and methods from discrete mathematics are used in analyzing VLSI electronic circuits. Computational geometry applies algorithms to geometrical problems and representations of geometrical objects, while computer image analysis applies them to representations of images. Theoretical computer science also includes the study of various continuous computational topics.\n\n\n\nThe ASCII codes for the word \"Wikipedia\", given here in binary, provide a way of representing the word in information theory, as well as for information-processing algorithms.\nInformation theory involves the quantification of information. Closely related is coding theory which is used to design efficient and reliable data transmission and storage methods. Information theory also includes continuous topics such as: analog signals, analog coding, analog encryption.\n\n\n\nLogic is the study of the principles of valid reasoning and inference, as well as of consistency, soundness, and completeness. For example, in most systems of logic (but not in intuitionistic logic) Peirce's law (((P→Q)→P)→P) is a theorem. For classical logic, it can be easily verified with a truth table. The study of mathematical proof is particularly important in logic, and has accumulated to automated theorem proving and formal verification of software.\nLogical formulas are discrete structures, as are proofs, which form finite trees[10] or, more generally, directed acyclic graph structures[11][12] (with each inference step combining one or more premise branches to give a single conclusion). The truth values of logical formulas usually form a finite set, generally restricted to two values: true and false, but logic can also be continuous-valued, e.g., fuzzy logic. Concepts such as infinite proof trees or infinite derivation trees have also been studied,[13] e.g. infinitary logic.\n\n\n\nSet theory is the branch of mathematics that studies sets, which are collections of objects, such as {blue, white, red} or the (infinite) set of all prime numbers. Partially ordered sets and sets with other relations have applications in several areas.\nIn discrete mathematics, countable sets (including finite sets) are the main focus. The beginning of set theory as a branch of mathematics is usually marked by Georg Cantor's work distinguishing between different kinds of infinite set, motivated by the study of trigonometric series, and further development of the theory of infinite sets is outside the scope of discrete mathematics. Indeed, contemporary work in descriptive set theory makes extensive use of traditional continuous mathematics.\n\n\n\nCombinatorics studies the ways in which discrete structures can be combined or arranged.\nEnumerative combinatorics concentrates on counting the number of certain combinatorial objects - e.g. the twelvefold way provides a unified framework for counting permutations, combinations and partitions.\nAnalytic combinatorics concerns the enumeration (i.e., determining the number) of combinatorial structures using tools from complex analysis and probability theory. In contrast with enumerative combinatorics which uses explicit combinatorial formulae and generating functions to describe the results, analytic combinatorics aims at obtaining asymptotic formulae.\nTopological combinatorics concerns the use of techniques from topology and algebraic topology/combinatorial topology in combinatorics.\nDesign theory is a study of combinatorial designs, which are collections of subsets with certain intersection properties.\nPartition theory studies various enumeration and asymptotic problems related to integer partitions, and is closely related to q-series, special functions and orthogonal polynomials. Originally a part of number theory and analysis, partition theory is now considered a part of combinatorics or an independent field.\nOrder theory is the study of partially ordered sets, both finite and infinite.\n\n\n\nGraph theory has close links to group theory. This truncated tetrahedron graph is related to the alternating group A4.\nGraph theory, the study of graphs and networks, is often considered part of combinatorics, but has grown large enough and distinct enough, with its own kind of problems, to be regarded as a subject in its own right.[14] Graphs are one of the prime objects of study in discrete mathematics. They are among the most ubiquitous models of both natural and human-made structures. They can model many types of relations and process dynamics in physical, biological and social systems. In computer science, they can represent networks of communication, data organization, computational devices, the flow of computation, etc. In mathematics, they are useful in geometry and certain parts of topology, e.g. knot theory. Algebraic graph theory has close links with group theory and topological graph theory has close links to topology. There are also continuous graphs; however, for the most part, research in graph theory falls within the domain of discrete mathematics.\n\n\nThe Ulam spiral of numbers, with black pixels showing prime numbers. This diagram hints at patterns in the distribution of prime numbers.\n\nNumber theory is concerned with the properties of numbers in general, particularly integers. It has applications to cryptography and cryptanalysis, particularly with regard to modular arithmetic, diophantine equations, linear and quadratic congruences, prime numbers and primality testing. Other discrete aspects of number theory include geometry of numbers. In analytic number theory, techniques from continuous mathematics are also used. Topics that go beyond discrete objects include transcendental numbers, diophantine approximation, p-adic analysis and function fields.\n\nAlgebraic structures[edit]\n\nAlgebraic structures occur as both discrete examples and continuous examples. Discrete algebras include: Boolean algebra used in logic gates and programming; relational algebra used in databases; discrete and finite versions of groups, rings and fields are important in algebraic coding theory; discrete semigroups and monoids appear in the theory of formal languages.\n\nDiscrete analogues of continuous mathematics[edit]\nThere are many concepts and theories in continuous mathematics which have discrete versions, such as discrete calculus, discrete Fourier transforms, discrete geometry, discrete logarithms, discrete differential geometry, discrete exterior calculus, discrete Morse theory, discrete optimization, discrete probability theory, discrete probability distribution, difference equations, discrete dynamical systems, and discrete vector measures.\n\nCalculus of finite differences, discrete analysis, and discrete calculus[edit]\nIn discrete calculus and the calculus of finite differences, a function defined on an interval of the integers is usually called a sequence. A sequence could be a finite sequence from a data source or an infinite sequence from a discrete dynamical system. Such a discrete function could be defined explicitly by a list (if its domain is finite), or by a formula for its general term, or it could be given implicitly by a recurrence relation or difference equation. Difference equations are similar to differential equations, but replace differentiation by taking the difference between adjacent terms; they can be used to approximate differential equations or (more often) studied in their own right. Many questions and methods concerning differential equations have counterparts for difference equations. For instance, where there are integral transforms in harmonic analysis for studying continuous functions or analogue signals, there are discrete transforms for discrete functions or digital signals. As well as discrete metric spaces, there are more general discrete topological spaces, finite metric spaces, finite topological spaces.\nThe time scale calculus is a unification of the theory of difference equations with that of differential equations, which has applications to fields requiring simultaneous modelling of discrete and continuous data. Another way of modeling such a situation is the notion of hybrid dynamical systems.\n\n\nDiscrete geometry and combinatorial geometry are about combinatorial properties of discrete collections of geometrical objects. A long-standing topic in discrete geometry is tiling of the plane.\nIn algebraic geometry, the concept of a curve can be extended to discrete geometries by taking the spectra of polynomial rings over finite fields to be models of the affine spaces over that field, and letting subvarieties or spectra of other rings provide the curves that lie in that space. Although the space in which the curves appear has a finite number of points, the curves are not so much sets of points as analogues of curves in continuous settings. For example, every point of the form  for  a field can be studied either as , a point, or as the spectrum  of the local ring at (x-c), a point together with a neighborhood around it. Algebraic varieties also have a well-defined notion of tangent space called the Zariski tangent space, making many features of calculus applicable even in finite settings.\n\n\nIn applied mathematics, discrete modelling is the discrete analogue of continuous modelling. In discrete modelling, discrete formulae are fit to data. A common method in this form of modelling is to use recurrence relation. Discretization concerns the process of transferring continuous models and equations into discrete counterparts, often for the purposes of making calculations easier by using approximations. Numerical analysis provides an important example.\n\n\nMuch research in graph theory was motivated by attempts to prove that all maps, like this one, can be colored using only four colors so that no areas of the same color share an edge. Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken proved this in 1976.[15]\nThe history of discrete mathematics has involved a number of challenging problems which have focused attention within areas of the field. In graph theory, much research was motivated by attempts to prove the four color theorem, first stated in 1852, but not proved until 1976 (by Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken, using substantial computer assistance).[15]\nIn logic, the second problem on David Hilbert's list of open problems presented in 1900 was to prove that the axioms of arithmetic are consistent. Gödel's second incompleteness theorem, proved in 1931, showed that this was not possible – at least not within arithmetic itself. Hilbert's tenth problem was to determine whether a given polynomial Diophantine equation with integer coefficients has an integer solution. In 1970, Yuri Matiyasevich proved that this could not be done.\nThe need to break German codes in World War II led to advances in cryptography and theoretical computer science, with the first programmable digital electronic computer being developed at England's Bletchley Park with the guidance of Alan Turing and his seminal work, On Computable Numbers.[16] The Cold War meant that cryptography remained important, with fundamental advances such as public-key cryptography being developed in the following decades. The telecommunications industry has also motivated advances in discrete mathematics, particularly in graph theory and information theory. Formal verification of statements in logic has been necessary for software development of safety-critical systems, and advances in automated theorem proving have been driven by this need.\nComputational geometry has been an important part of the computer graphics incorporated into modern video games and computer-aided design tools.\nSeveral fields of discrete mathematics, particularly theoretical computer science, graph theory, and combinatorics, are important in addressing the challenging bioinformatics problems associated with understanding the tree of life.[17]\nCurrently, one of the most famous open problems in theoretical computer science is the P = NP problem, which involves the relationship between the complexity classes P and NP. The Clay Mathematics Institute has offered a $1 million USD prize for the first correct proof, along with prizes for six other mathematical problems.[18]\n\n\n\nOutline of discrete mathematics\nCyberchase, a show that teaches discrete mathematics to children\n\n\n^ Richard Johnsonbaugh, Discrete Mathematics, Prentice Hall, 2008.\n\n^ Franklin, James (2017). \"Discrete and continuous: a fundamental dichotomy in mathematics\" (PDF).

    "content": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\t\t\t\t\t(Redirected from Q sharp)\nThe correct title of this article is Q# (programming language). The substitution of the # is due to technical restrictions.\n\nQ#ParadigmQuantum, functional, imperativeDesigned byMicrosoft Research (quantum architectures and computation group; QuArC)DeveloperMicrosoftFirst appearedDecember 11, 2017[1]Typing disciplineStatic, strongPlatformCommon Language InfrastructureLicenseMIT License[2]Filename extensions.qsWebsitelearn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/quantum/Influenced byC#, F#, Python\n\nQ# (pronounced Q sharp) is a domain-specific programming language used for expressing quantum algorithms.[3] It was initially released to the public by Microsoft as part of the Quantum Development Kit.[4]\nQ# works in conjunction with classical languages such as C#, Python and F#, and is designed to allow the use of traditional programming concepts in quantum computing, including functions with variables and branches as well as a syntax-highlighted development environment with a quantum debugger.[1][5][6]\n\n\n\nHistorically, Microsoft Research had two teams interested in quantum computing: the QuArC team based in Redmond, Washington,[7] directed by Krysta Svore, that explored the construction of quantum circuitry, and Station Q initially located in Santa Barbara and directed by Michael Freedman, that explored topological quantum computing.[8][9]\nDuring a Microsoft Ignite Keynote on September 26, 2017, Microsoft announced that they were going to release a new programming language geared specifically towards quantum computers.[10] On December 11, 2017, Microsoft released Q# as a part of the Quantum Development Kit.[4]\nAt Build 2019, Microsoft announced that it would be open-sourcing the Quantum Development Kit, including its Q# compilers and simulators.[11]\nTo support Q#, Microsoft developed Quantum Intermediate Representation (QIR) in 2023 as a common interface between programming languages and target quantum processors. The company also announced a compiler extension that generates QIR from Q#.[12]\nBettina Heim used to lead the Q# language development effort.[13][14]\n\n\nQ# is available as a separately downloaded extension for Visual Studio,[15] but it can also be run as an independent tool from the command line or Visual Studio Code. Q# was introduced on Windows and is available on MacOS and Linux.[16]\nThe Quantum Development Kit includes a quantum simulator capable of running Q# and simulated 30 logical qubits.[17][18]\nIn order to invoke the quantum simulator, another .NET programming language, usually C#, is used, which provides the (classical) input data for the simulator and reads the (classical) output data from the simulator.[19]\n\n\nA primary feature of Q# is the ability to create and use qubits for algorithms. As a consequence, some of the most prominent features of Q# are the ability to entangle and introduce superpositioning to qubits via controlled NOT gates and Hadamard gates, respectively, as well as Toffoli Gates, Pauli X, Y, Z Gate, and many more which are used for a variety of operations (See quantum logic gates).[citation needed]\nThe hardware stack that will eventually come together with Q# is expected to implement Qubits as topological qubits. The quantum simulator that is shipped with the Quantum Development Kit today is capable of processing up to 32 qubits on a user machine and up to 40 qubits on Azure.[20]\n\nDocumentation and resources[edit]\nCurrently, the resources available for Q# are scarce, but the official documentation is published: Microsoft Developer Network: Q#. Microsoft Quantum Github repository is also a large collection of sample programs implementing a variety of Quantum algorithms and their tests.\nMicrosoft has also hosted a Quantum Coding contest on Codeforces, called Microsoft Q# Coding Contest - Codeforces, and also provided related material to help answer the questions in the blog posts, plus the detailed solutions in the tutorials.\nMicrosoft hosts a set of learning exercises to help learn Q# on GitHub: microsoft/QuantumKatas with links to resources, and answers to the problems.\n\n\nQ# is syntactically related to both C# and F# yet also has some significant differences.\n\nSimilarities with C#[edit]\nUses namespace for code isolation\nAll statements end with a ;\nCurly braces are used for statements of scope\nSingle line comments are done using //\nVariable data types such as Int Double String and Bool are similar, although capitalised (and Int is 64-bit)[21]\nQubits are allocated and disposed inside a using block.\nLambda functions are defined using the => operator.\nResults are returned using the return keyword.\nSimilarities with F#[edit]\nVariables are declared using either let or mutable[3]\nFirst-order functions\nModules, which are imported using the open keyword\nThe datatype is declared after the variable name\nThe range operator ..\nfor … in loops\nEvery operation/function has a return value, rather than void.

Its routing function enables internetworking, and essentially establishes the Internet.\nIP has the task of delivering packets from the source host to the destination host solely based on the IP addresses in the packet headers. For this purpose, IP defines packet structures that encapsulate the data to be delivered. It also defines addressing methods that are used to label the datagram with source and destination information.\nIP was the connectionless datagram service in the original Transmission Control Program introduced by Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn in 1974, which was complemented by a connection-oriented service that became the basis for the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). The Internet protocol suite is therefore often referred to as TCP/IP.\nThe first major version of IP, Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4), is the dominant protocol of the Internet. Its successor is Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6), which has been in increasing deployment on the public Internet since around 2006.[1]\n\n\n\nEncapsulation of application data carried by UDP to a link protocol frame\nThe Internet Protocol is responsible for addressing host interfaces, encapsulating data into datagrams (including fragmentation and reassembly) and routing datagrams from a source host interface to a destination host interface across one or more IP networks.[2] For these purposes, the Internet Protocol defines the format of packets and provides an addressing system.\nEach datagram has two components: a header and a payload. The IP header includes a source IP address, a destination IP address, and other metadata needed to route and deliver the datagram. The payload is the data that is transported. This method of nesting the data payload in a packet with a header is called encapsulation.\nIP addressing entails the assignment of IP addresses and associated parameters to host interfaces. The address space is divided into subnets, involving the designation of network prefixes. IP routing is performed by all hosts, as well as routers, whose main function is to transport packets across network boundaries. Routers communicate with one another via specially designed routing protocols, either interior gateway protocols or exterior gateway protocols, as needed for the topology of the network.[3]\n\n\n\n\n\nRouting schemes\n\n\nUnicast\n\n\n\n\nBroadcast\n\n\n\n\nMulticast\n\n\n\n\nAnycast\n\n\n\nThere are four principal addressing methods in the Internet Protocol:\n\nUnicast delivers a message to a single specific node using a one-to-one association between a sender and destination: each destination address uniquely identifies a single receiver endpoint.\nBroadcast delivers a message to all nodes in the network using a one-to-all association; a single datagram (or packet) from one sender is routed to all of the possibly multiple endpoints associated with the broadcast address. The network automatically replicates datagrams as needed to reach all the recipients within the scope of the broadcast, which is generally an entire network subnet.\nMulticast delivers a message to a group of nodes that have expressed interest in receiving the message using a one-to-many-of-many or many-to-many-of-many association; datagrams are routed simultaneously in a single transmission to many recipients. Multicast differs from broadcast in that the destination address designates a subset, not necessarily all, of the accessible nodes.\nAnycast delivers a message to any one out of a group of nodes, typically the one nearest to the source using a one-to-one-of-many[4] association where datagrams are routed to any single member of a group of potential receivers that are all identified by the same destination address.  The routing algorithm selects the single receiver from the group based on which is the nearest according to some distance or cost measure.\n\nA timeline for the development of the transmission control Protocol TCP and Internet Protocol IP\nFirst Internet demonstration, linking the ARPANET, PRNET, and SATNET on November 22, 1977\nIn May 1974, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) published a paper entitled \"A Protocol for Packet Network Intercommunication\".[5] The paper's authors, Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn, described an internetworking protocol for sharing resources using packet switching among network nodes. A central control component of this model was the Transmission Control Program that incorporated both connection-oriented links and datagram services between hosts. The monolithic Transmission Control Program was later divided into a modular architecture consisting of the Transmission Control Protocol and User Datagram Protocol at the transport layer and the Internet Protocol at the internet layer. The model became known as the Department of Defense (DoD) Internet Model and Internet protocol suite, and informally as TCP/IP.\nThe following Internet Experiment Note (IEN) documents describe the evolution of the Internet Protocol into the modern version of IPv4:[6]\n\nIEN 2 Comments on Internet Protocol and TCP (August 1977) describes the need to separate the TCP and Internet Protocol functionalities (which were previously combined).  It proposes the first version of the IP header, using 0 for the version field.\nIEN 26 A Proposed New Internet Header Format (February 1978) describes a version of the IP header that uses a 1-bit version field.\nIEN 28 Draft Internetwork Protocol Description Version 2 (February 1978) describes IPv2.\nIEN 41 Internetwork Protocol Specification Version 4 (June 1978) describes the first protocol to be called IPv4.  The IP header is different from the modern IPv4 header.\nIEN 44 Latest Header Formats (June 1978) describes another version of IPv4, also with a header different from the modern IPv4 header.\nIEN 54 Internetwork Protocol Specification Version 4 (September 1978) is the first description of IPv4 using the header that would become standardized in 1980 as RFC 760.\nIEN 80\nIEN 111\nIEN 123\nIEN 128/RFC 760 (1980)\nIP versions 1 to 3 were experimental versions, designed between 1973 and 1978.[7] Versions 2 and 3 supported variable-length addresses ranging between 1 and 16 octets (between 8 and 128 bits).[8] An early draft of version 4 supported variable-length addresses of up to 256 octets (up to 2048 bits)[9] but this was later abandoned in favor of a fixed-size 32-bit address in the final version of IPv4. This remains the dominant internetworking protocol in use in the Internet Layer; the number 4 identifies the protocol version, carried in every IP datagram. IPv4 is defined in RFC 791 (1981).\nVersion number 5 was used by the Internet Stream Protocol, an experimental streaming protocol that was not adopted.[7]\nThe successor to IPv4 is IPv6. IPv6 was a result of several years of experimentation and dialog during which various protocol models were proposed, such as TP/IX (RFC 1475), PIP (RFC 1621) and TUBA (TCP and UDP with Bigger Addresses, RFC 1347). Its most prominent difference from version 4 is the size of the addresses. While IPv4 uses 32 bits for addressing, yielding c. 4.3 billion (4.3×109) addresses, IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses providing c. 3.4×1038 addresses. Although adoption of IPv6 has been slow, as of January 2023, most countries in the world show significant adoption of IPv6,[10] with over 41% of Google's traffic being carried over IPv6 connections.[11]\nThe assignment of the new protocol as IPv6 was uncertain until due diligence assured that IPv6 had not been used previously.[12] Other Internet Layer protocols have been assigned version numbers,[13] such as 7 (IP/TX), 8 and 9 (historic). Notably, on April 1, 1994, the IETF published an April Fools' Day RfC about IPv9.[14] IPv9 was also used in an alternate proposed address space expansion called TUBA.[15] A 2004 Chinese proposal for an IPv9 protocol appears to be unrelated to all of these, and is not endorsed by the IETF.\n\n\n\nAs the version number is carried in a 4-bit field, only numbers 0–15 can be assigned.\n\n\n\n\nIP version\n\nDescription\n\nYear\n\nStatus\n\n\n0\n\nInternet Protocol, pre-v4\nN/A\nReserved[16]\n\n\n1\n\nExperimental version\n1973\nObsolete\n\n\n2\n\nExperimental version\n1977\nObsolete\n\n\n3\n\nExperimental version\n1978\nObsolete\n\n\n4\n\nInternet Protocol version 4 (IPv4)[17]\n1981\nActive\n\n\n5\n\nInternet Stream Protocol (ST)\n1979\nObsolete; superseded by ST-II or ST2\n\n\nInternet Stream Protocol (ST-II or ST2)[18]\n1987\nObsolete; superseded by ST2+\n\n\nInternet Stream Protocol (ST2+)\n1995\nObsolete\n\n\n6\n\nSimple Internet Protocol (SIP)\nN/A\nObsolete; merged into IPv6 in 1995[16]\n\n\nInternet Protocol version 6 (IPv6)[19]\n1995\nActive\n\n\n7\n\nTP/IX The Next Internet (IPv7)[20]\n1993\nObsolete[21]\n\n\n8\n\nP Internet Protocol (PIP)[22]\n1994\nObsolete; merged into SIP in 1993\n\n\n9\n\nTCP and UDP over Bigger Addresses (TUBA)\n1992\nObsolete[23]\n\n\nIPv9\n1994\nApril Fools' Day joke[24]\n\n\nChinese IPv9\n2004\nAbandoned\n\n\n10–14\n\nN/A\nN/A\nUnassigned\n\n\n15\n\nVersion field sentinel value\nN/A\nReserved\n\n\nThe design of the Internet protocol suite adheres to the end-to-end principle, a concept adapted from the CYCLADES project. Under the end-to-end principle, the network infrastructure is considered inherently unreliable at any single network element or transmission medium and is dynamic in terms of the availability of links and nodes. No central monitoring or performance measurement facility exists that tracks or maintains the state of the network. For the benefit of reducing network complexity, the intelligence in the network is located in the end nodes.\nAs a consequence of this design, the Internet Protocol only provides best-effort delivery and its service is characterized as unreliable. In network architectural parlance, it is a connectionless protocol, in contrast to connection-oriented communication. Various fault conditions may occur, such as data corruption, packet loss and duplication. Because routing is dynamic, meaning every packet is treated independently, and because the network maintains no state based on the path of prior packets, different packets may be routed to the same destination via different paths, resulting in out-of-order delivery to the receiver.\nAll fault conditions in the network must be detected and compensated for by the participating end nodes. The upper layer protocols of the Internet protocol suite are responsible for resolving reliability issues. For example, a host may buffer network data to ensure correct ordering before the data is delivered to an application.\nIPv4 provides safeguards to ensure that the header of an IP packet is error-free. A routing node discards packets that fail a header checksum test. Although the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) provides notification of errors, a routing node is not required to notify either end node of errors. IPv6, by contrast, operates without header checksums, since current link layer technology is assumed to provide sufficient error detection.[25][26]\n\nLink capacity and capability[edit]\nThe dynamic nature of the Internet and the diversity of its components provide no guarantee that any particular path is actually capable of, or suitable for, performing the data transmission requested. One of the technical constraints is the size of data packets possible on a given link. Facilities exist to examine the maximum transmission unit (MTU) size of the local link and Path MTU Discovery can be used for the entire intended path to the destination.[27]\nThe IPv4 internetworking layer automatically fragments a datagram into smaller units for transmission when the link MTU is exceeded. IP provides re-ordering of fragments received out of order.[28] An IPv6 network does not perform fragmentation in network elements, but requires end hosts and higher-layer protocols to avoid exceeding the path MTU.[29]\nThe Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is an example of a protocol that adjusts its segment size to be smaller than the MTU. The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and ICMP disregard MTU size, thereby forcing IP to fragment oversized datagrams.[30]\n\n\nDuring the design phase of the ARPANET and the early Internet, the security aspects and needs of a public, international network were not adequately anticipated.  Consequently, many Internet protocols exhibited vulnerabilities highlighted by network attacks and later security assessments. In 2008, a thorough security assessment and proposed mitigation of problems was published.[31] The IETF has been pursuing further studies.[32]\n\n\n\nICANN\nIP routing\nList of IP protocol numbers\nList of IP version numbers\nNext-generation network\nNew IP (proposal)\n\n\n^ The Economics of Transition to Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) (Report).

    "content": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\t\t\t\t\t\nChelsea's football squad in 1905 pictured with support staff\nA football team is a group of players selected to play together in the various team sports known as football. Such teams could be selected to play in a match against an opposing team, to represent a football club, group, state or nation, an all-star team or even selected as a hypothetical team (such as a dream team or team of the century) and never play an actual match.\nThe difference between a football team and a football club is incorporation, a football club is an entity which is formed and governed by a committee and has members which may consist of supporters in addition to players. The benefit of club formation is that it gives teams access to additional volunteer or paid support staff, facilities and equipment. \n\n\n\nThere are several varieties of football, including association football, gridiron football, Australian rules football, Gaelic football, rugby league and rugby union. The number of players selected for each team, within these varieties and their associated codes, can vary substantially. Sometimes, the word \"team\" may be limited to those who play on the field in a match and does not always include other players who may take part as replacements or emergency players. \"Football squad\" may be used to be inclusive of these support and reserve players.\nThe words team and club are sometimes used interchangeably by supporters, typically referring to the team within the club playing in the highest division or competition. A football club is a type of sports club which is an organized or incorporated body. Typically these will have a committee, secretary, president, or chairperson, registrar and members. Football clubs typically have a set of rules, including rules under which they play and are themselves typically members of a league or association which are affiliated with a governing body within their sport. Clubs may field multiple teams from their registered players (which may participate in several different divisions or leagues). A club is responsible for ensuring the continued existence of its teams in their respective competitions. The oldest football clubs date back to the early 19th century. While records exist for most incorporated clubs, they do not exist for all football clubs. Standalone clubs are usually run like businesses and appear on official registers. However many football clubs were formed as part of larger organisations (schools, athletic clubs, societies) and therefore public records of their formation and operation may not be kept unless they compete with other teams. Football clubs may also be dormant for periods and be re-formed (for example going into recess for reasons such as war or lack of a league or competition to participate in) and even switch between football codes. Likewise, a football club may fold if it becomes insolvent or is incapable of fielding a team to play matches.\n\nVariation of player numbers among football codes[edit]\nThe 18 senior players of Port Adelaide Football Club's 1914 Champions of Australia team\nThe number of players that take part in the sport simultaneously, thus forming the team are:\n\nAssociation football: 11[1]\nSeven-a-side football:7\nIndoor soccer: 5–7\nFutsal, beach football, five-a-side football: 5\nAmerican football: 11\nArena football: 8\nCanadian football: 12\nRugby league: 13\nRugby league nines: 9\nRugby union: 15\nRugby sevens: 7\nGaelic football: 15\nAustralian rules football: 18\nLists of association football teams[edit]\nList of men's national association football teams\nList of women's association football clubs\nList of women's national association football teams\nLists of Australian rules football teams[edit]\nList of Australian rules football clubs\n\nFootball club (association football)\nFootball club (East Germany)\n\n\n^ \"Law 3 – The Players\".

Produced by Monkey Massacre Productions and 21 Laps Entertainment, the first season was released on Netflix on July 15, 2016. The second and third seasons followed in October 2017 and July 2019, respectively, and the fourth season was released in two parts in May and July 2022. The fifth and final season is being released in three parts in November and December 2025. The show combines elements of horror, science fiction, mystery, fantasy, and coming-of-age drama.\nSet in the 1980s, the series centers on the residents of the fictional small town of Hawkins, Indiana, after a young girl with psychokinetic abilities, named Eleven, opens a gateway between Earth and a hostile alternate dimension known as the Upside Down at a nearby human experimentation facility. The cast includes Winona Ryder, David Harbour, Finn Wolfhard, Millie Bobby Brown, Gaten Matarazzo, Caleb McLaughlin, Natalia Dyer, Charlie Heaton, Cara Buono, Matthew Modine, Noah Schnapp, Sadie Sink, Joe Keery, Dacre Montgomery, Sean Astin, Paul Reiser, Maya Hawke, Priah Ferguson, Brett Gelman, Jamie Campbell Bower, and Linda Hamilton.\nThe Duffer Brothers developed Stranger Things as a blend of investigative drama and supernatural horror with childlike wonder, infusing references to the popular culture of the 1980s. Several thematic and directorial elements were inspired by the works of Steven Spielberg, John Carpenter, David Lynch, Stephen King, Wes Craven, H. P. Lovecraft, and FromSoftware. The show also drew inspiration from Cold War-era experiments and conspiracy theories involving secret government programs.\nStranger Things has received critical acclaim throughout its run, with praise for its characterization, atmosphere, acting, directing, writing, and nostalgic homage to 1980s cinema, making it a hallmark of 1980s nostalgia.[6][7][8] It has garnered many accolades, and many publications consider it among the greatest television shows ever made. Stranger Things is a flagship series for Netflix, drawing record viewership with each season's release. The series has expanded into a media franchise, including an animated spin-off, Stranger Things: Tales from '85,[9][10] and a 2023 West End prequel stage play, Stranger Things: The First Shadow. It has also inspired several books, comics, tie-in media, a pop-up shop, and a Dungeons and Dragons board game based on the series.\n\n\nOverview\nStranger Things is set in the fictional rural town of Hawkins, Indiana, in the 1980s. Hawkins is described (in Season 2) as, 'the town where nothing ever happens'. \nThe nearby Hawkins National Laboratory ostensibly performs scientific research for the United States Department of Energy, but also secretly experiments with the paranormal and supernatural, sometimes with human test subjects. They inadvertently create a portal to an alternate dimension referred to as the Upside Down, whose presence begins to affect the residents of Hawkins in unusual ways.[11][12]\nThe first season begins in November 1983 when Will Byers is abducted by a creature from the Upside Down, dubbed the \"Demogorgon\". His mother, Joyce, Police Chief Jim Hopper, and a group of volunteers search for him. A young psychokinetic girl named Eleven escapes from the laboratory and is found by Will's friends, Mike Wheeler, Dustin Henderson, and Lucas Sinclair. Eleven befriends and assists them in their efforts to find Will. Mike's older sister Nancy and Will's older brother Jonathan learn about the Demogorgon and the existence of the Upside Down.[13]\nThe second season is set eleven months later, in October 1984. Will has been rescued, but he begins experiencing premonitions of the fall of Hawkins caused by a creature in the Upside Down. When it is discovered that Will is still being affected by an entity from the Upside Down, his friends and family learn that anything connected to the dimension is part of a hive mind known as the Mind Flayer. Lucas earns the affection of new classmate Max Mayfield, while Dustin teams up with Nancy's ex-boyfriend Steve Harrington to fend off a horde of adolescent Demogorgons that soon threaten the rest of their friends.[14]\nThe third season is set nine months later, in the days leading up to the Fourth of July celebration in 1985. The new Starcourt Mall becomes the center of attention for Hawkins residents. Hopper adopts Eleven and becomes increasingly concerned about her relationship with Mike. Dustin, Steve, and Steve's coworker Robin Buckley, along with Lucas's younger sister Erica, discover that a secret Soviet laboratory beneath Starcourt is attempting to reopen the gateway to the Upside Down. Meanwhile, the Mind Flayer possesses Max's stepbrother Billy Hargrove and begins creating physical vessels made of melted flesh to carry out its will.[15][16]\nThe fourth season is set eight months later, in March 1986. The Byers family and a de-powered Eleven have moved to Lenora, California, for a fresh start. In Hawkins, a being from the Upside Down—later dubbed Vecna—begins killing teenagers to open gates between the two worlds and targets Max as his next victim. To help Eleven regain her powers, Dr. Sam Owens takes her to a secure facility. Joyce and Murray Bauman travel to Russia to rescue Hopper from a Gulag in the Kamchatka region. Vecna reveals to Nancy and Eleven that he was the murderous first test subject at the Hawkins Laboratory who later took control of the Mind Flayer after being banished to the Upside Down by Eleven.\nThe fifth and final season is set in the fall of 1987. The group seeks to find and kill Vecna after rifts open throughout Hawkins. Their mission is complicated when the military arrives to hunt Eleven, and when Nancy and Mike's younger sister Holly is kidnapped by Vecna.

They wrote and produced their 2015 film Hidden, in which they emulated the style of M. Night Shyamalan. However, due to changes at Warner Bros., its distributor, it did not see wide release and the Duffers were unsure of their future.[30] To their surprise, television producer Donald De Line approached them, impressed with Hidden's script, and offered them the opportunity to work on episodes of Wayward Pines with Shyamalan. The brothers were mentored by Shyamalan during the episode's production so that when they finished, they felt they were ready to produce their own television series.[31]\nThe Duffers prepared a script[when?] similar to the series' eventual pilot episode, along with a 20-page pitch book to help shop the series to networks.[32] They pitched the story to about 15 cable networks,[33] all of whom felt a plot with children as leading characters would not work and asked the brothers to either make it a children's series or drop the children and focus on Hopper's investigation into the paranormal.[31]\nIn early 2015, Dan Cohen, the VP of 21 Laps Entertainment, brought the script to his colleague Shawn Levy. They subsequently invited the Duffer Brothers to their office and purchased the rights for the series, giving the brothers full authorship. After reading the pilot, the streaming service Netflix purchased the whole season for an undisclosed sum,[34] and in April of the same year, the series was announced for a 2016 release.[35]\nThe Duffer Brothers stated that at the time they pitched to Netflix, the company had already been recognized for its original programming in shows such as House of Cards and Orange Is the New Black, with well-recognized producers behind them, and were ready to start giving upcoming producers like them a chance.[32] The brothers started casting and brought Levy and Cohen in as the other executive producers to discuss storylines, with Levy also directing for the show.[36]\n\n\n\nMontauk is an eight-hour sci-fi horror epic. Set in Long Island in 1980 and inspired by the supernatural classics of that era, we explore the crossroads where the ordinary meet the extraordinary...emotional, cinematic and rooted in character, Montauk is a love letter to the golden age of Steven Spielberg and Stephen King – a marriage of human drama and supernatural fear.\n\n\n — The Duffer Brothers' original pitch for Montauk[37]\n\nThe book cover the Duffer Brothers created to pitch Montauk. For this, they took inspiration from Stephen King book covers such as Firestarter.\nThe series was originally known as Montauk. The setting was then Montauk, New York, and nearby Long Island locations. Montauk figured into a number of real world conspiracy theories involving secret government experiments.[35][38] The brothers had chosen Montauk as it had further Spielberg ties with the film Jaws, where Montauk was used for the fictional setting of Amity Island.[39] After deciding to change the narrative of the series to take place in the fictional town of Hawkins instead, the brothers felt they could now do things to the town, such as placing it under quarantine, that they really could not envision with a real location.[39]\nWith the change in location, they had to come up with a new title for the series under direction from Netflix's Ted Sarandos so that they could start marketing it to the public. The brothers started by using a copy of Stephen King's Firestarter novel to consider the title's font and appearance, and came up with a long list of potential alternatives. Stranger Things came about as it sounded similar to another King novel, Needful Things, though Matt noted they still had a \"lot of heated arguments\" over this final title.[40]\nTo pitch the series, the Duffer Brothers showcased images, footage and music from classic 1970s and 1980s films such as E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Poltergeist, Hellraiser, Stand by Me, Firestarter, A Nightmare on Elm Street and Jaws, in order to establish the tone of the series.[37]\n\nWriting\nThe idea of Stranger Things started with how the brothers felt they could take the concept of the 2013 film Prisoners, detailing the moral struggles a father goes through when his daughter is kidnapped, and expand it out over eight or so hours in a serialized television approach. As they focused on the missing child aspect of the story, they wanted to introduce the idea of \"childlike sensibilities\" they could offer, and toyed around with the idea of a monster that could consume humans. The brothers thought the combination of these things \"was the best thing ever\".[31]\nTo introduce this monster into the narrative, they considered \"bizarre experiments we had read about taking place in the Cold War\" such as Project MKUltra, which gave a way to ground the monster's existence in science rather than something spiritual. This also helped them to decide on using 1983 as the time period, as it was a year before the film Red Dawn came out, which focused on Cold War paranoia.[31] Subsequently, they were able to use all their own personal inspirations from the 1980s, the decade in which they were born, as elements of the series,[31][41] crafting it in the realm of science fiction and horror.[42]\nOther influences cited by the Duffer Brothers include: Stephen King novels; films produced by Steven Spielberg, John Carpenter, David Lynch, Wes Craven,[43][44][45][46] and Guillermo del Toro;[40] films such as Star Wars, Alien, and Stand by Me;[40][44][47] Japanese anime such as Akira and Elfen Lied;[40][43] and several video games including Silent Hill, Dark Souls and The Last of Us.[48][49][43] The Duffer Brothers believe that they may have brought influences from other works unintentionally, including Beyond the Black Rainbow and D.A.R.Y.L., discovered by reviewing fan feedback on the series.[39] Several websites and publications have found other pop culture references in the series, particularly references to 1980s pop culture.[50][51][52][53] The main villain for the last seasons was inspired by the villains that scared the brothers when they watched the movies and miniseries as children: Freddy Krueger, Pinhead and Pennywise.[54]\nWith Netflix as the platform, the Duffer Brothers were not limited to a typical 22-episode format, opting for the eight-episode approach. They had been concerned that a 22-episode season on broadcast television would be difficult to \"tell a cinematic story\" with that many episodes. Eight episodes allowed them to give time to characterization in addition to narrative development; if they had less time available, they would have had to remain committed to telling a horror film as soon as the monster was introduced and abandon the characterization.[32] Within the eight episodes, the brothers aimed to make the first season \"feel like a big movie\" with all the major plot lines completed so that \"the audience feels satisfied\", but left enough unresolved to indicate \"there's a bigger mythology, and there's a lot of dangling threads at the end\", something that could be explored in further seasons if Netflix opted to create more.[55]\nRegarding writing for the children characters of the series, the Duffer Brothers considered themselves as outcasts from other students while in high school and thus found it easy to write for Mike and his friends, and particularly for Barb.[40] Joyce was fashioned after Richard Dreyfuss' character Roy Neary in Close Encounters of the Third Kind, as she appears \"absolutely bonkers\" to everyone else as she tries to find Will.[56]\n\nCasting\nThe Duffer Brothers cast David Harbour as Chief Hopper, believing this was his opportunity to portray a lead character.\nIn June 2015, it was announced that Winona Ryder and David Harbour had joined the series as Joyce and as the unnamed chief of police, respectively.[17] Ryder's sole condition to the Duffers in accepting the part was that, if a Beetlejuice sequel ever materialized as she and Tim Burton had been discussing since 2000, they had to let her take a break to shoot it, a condition the Duffers agreed and ultimately proved to work out when Beetlejuice Beetlejuice was greenlighted.[57] The brothers' casting director Carmen Cuba had suggested Ryder for the role of Joyce, which the two were immediately drawn to because of her predominance in the films of the 1980s.[31]\nLevy believed Ryder could \"wretch up the emotional urgency and yet find layers and nuance and different sides of [Joyce]\". Ryder praised that the show's multiple storylines required her to act for Joyce as if \"she's out of her mind, but she's actually kind of onto something\", and that the producers had faith she could pull off the difficult role.[58] The Duffer Brothers had been interested in Harbour before, who until Stranger Things primarily had smaller roles as villainous characters, and they felt that he had been \"waiting too long for this opportunity\" to play a lead, while Harbour himself was thrilled by the script and the chance to play \"a broken, flawed, anti-hero character\".[40][59]\nAdditional casting followed two months later with Finn Wolfhard as Mike, Millie Bobby Brown in an undisclosed role, Gaten Matarazzo as Dustin, Caleb McLaughlin as Lucas, Natalia Dyer as Nancy, and Charlie Heaton as Jonathan.[18] In September 2015, Cara Buono joined the cast as Karen,[19] followed by Matthew Modine as Martin Brenner a month later.[20] Additional cast who recur include Noah Schnapp as Will,[18][23] Shannon Purser as Barbara \"Barb\" Holland,[60] Joe Keery as Steve Harrington,[24][23] and Ross Partridge as Lonnie,[61] among others.\nActors auditioning for the children roles read lines from Stand by Me.[31] The Duffer Brothers estimated they went through about a thousand different child actors for the roles. They noted that Wolfhard was already \"a movie buff\" of the films from the 1980s period and easily filled the role, while they found Matarazzo's audition to be much more authentic than most of the other audition tapes, and selected him after a single viewing of his audition tape.[32]\nAs casting was started immediately after Netflix greenlit the show, and prior to the scripts being fully completed, this allowed some of the actors' takes on the roles to reflect into the script. The casting of the young actors for Will and his friends had been done just after the first script was completed, and subsequent scripts incorporated aspects from these actors.[55] The brothers said Modine provided significant input on the character of Dr. Brenner, whom they had not really fleshed out before as they considered him the hardest character to write for given his limited appearances within the narrative.[56]\n\nFilming\nEmory University's former Georgia Mental Health Institute served as the location of Hawkins National Laboratory.\nThe brothers had desired to film the series around the Long Island area to match the initial Montauk concept. However, with filming scheduled to take place in November 2015, it was difficult to shoot in Long Island in the cold weather, and the production started scouting locations in and around the Atlanta, Georgia, area. The brothers, who grew up in North Carolina, found many places that reminded them of their own childhoods in that area, and felt the area would work well with the narrative shift to the fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana.[39]\nFilming for the first season began in November 2015 and was extensively done in Atlanta, Georgia, with the Duffer Brothers and Levy handling the direction of individual episodes.[62] Jackson served as the basis of the fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana.[63][64] Other shooting locations included the Georgia Mental Health Institute as the Hawkins National Laboratory site, Bellwood Quarry, and Patrick Henry High School in Stockbridge, Georgia, for the middle and high school scenes.[65]\nEmory University's Continuing Education Department, the former city hall in Douglasville, Georgia, the Georgia International Horse Park in Conyers, Georgia, the probate court in Butts County, Georgia, Old East Point Library and East Point First Baptist Church in East Point, Georgia, Fayetteville, Georgia, Stone Mountain Park, Palmetto, Georgia, and Winston, Georgia.[66][clarification needed] Set work was done at Screen Gem Studios in Atlanta[66] and the first season was filmed with a RED Epic Dragon camera.[56][67] Filming for the first season concluded in early 2016.[63]\nAfter the third season finished filming, producers considered the idea of keeping the Starcourt Mall set as a permanent attraction for fans to visit, but ultimately decided against it.[68]\nThe fourth season was expected to consist of eight episodes, with the first episode titled \"Chapter One: The Hellfire Club\".[69] Filming for the season was slated to begin in January 2020 and to last through August.[70] With the release of a February 2020 teaser for the fourth season, the Duffers confirmed that production had started.[71] Some filming for the fourth season took place at Lukiškės Prison and nearby in Vilnius, Lithuania.[72] In March 2020, production was stopped due to the COVID-19 pandemic,[73] and resumed that September.[74]\nFilming for the fifth and final season was expected to start in June 2023,[75] before the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike delayed it to January 8, 2024.[76] Production began on that day and wrapped on December 20.[77]\n\nVisual effects\nTo create the aged effect for the series, a film grain was added over the footage, which was captured by scanning in film stock from the 1980s.[56] The Duffer Brothers wanted to scare the audience, but not to necessarily make the series violent or gory, following in line with how the 1980s Amblin Entertainment films drove the creation of the PG-13 movie rating. They said such films were \"much more about mood and atmosphere and suspense and dread than they are about gore\", though they were not afraid to push into more scary elements, particularly towards the end of the first season.[56]\nThe brothers had wanted to avoid any computer-generated effects for the monster and other parts of the series and stay with practical effects, so they created an animatronic to play the part of the Demogorgon.[78][79] However, the six-month filming time left them little time to plan out and test practical effects rigs for some of the shots. They went with a middle ground of using constructed props including one for the monster whenever they could, but for other shots, such as when the monster bursts through a wall, they opted to use digital effects. Post-production on the first season was completed the week before it was released to Netflix.[31]\nThe title sequence uses closeups of the letters in the Stranger Things title with a red tint against a black background as they slide into place within the title. The sequence was created by the studio Imaginary Forces, formerly part of R/GA, led by creative director Michelle Doughtey.[80] Levy introduced the studio to the Duffer Brothers, who explained their vision of the 1980s-inspired series, which helped the studio to fix the concept the producers wanted. Later, but prior to filming, the producers sent Imaginary Forces the pilot script, the synth-heavy background music for the titles, as well as the various book covers from King and other authors that they had used to establish the title and imagery, and were looking for a similar approach for the series' titles, primarily using a typographical sequence.[81]\nThey took inspiration from several title sequences of works from the 1980s that were previously designed by Richard Greenberg under R/GA, such as Altered States and The Dead Zone. They also got input from Dan Perri, who worked on the title credits of several 1980s films. Various iterations included having letters vanish, to reflect the \"missing\" theme of the series, and having letters cast shadows on others, alluding to the mysteries, before settling into the sliding letters. The studio began working on the title sequence before filming, and took about a month off during the filming process to let the producers get immersed in the series and come back with more input.[81]\nInitially they had been working with various fonts for the title and used close-ups of the best features of these fonts, but near the end the producers wanted to work with ITC Benguiat, requiring them to rework those shots. The final sequence is fully computer generated, but they took inspiration from testing some practical effects, such as using Kodalith masks as would have been done in the 1980s, to develop the appropriate filters for the rendering software. The individual episode title cards used a \"fly through\" approach, similar to the film Bullitt, which the producers had suggested to the studio.[81]\n\nMusic\n\nMichael Stein and Kyle Dixon of the electronic band Survive have composed the original soundtrack for the show, including the show's theme song.[82] It makes extensive use of synthesizers in homage to 1980s artists and film composers including Jean-Michel Jarre, Tangerine Dream, Vangelis, Goblin, John Carpenter, Giorgio Moroder, and Fabio Frizzi.[83] According to Stein and Dixon, the Duffer Brothers had been fans of Survive's music since the 2014 film The Guest.[82][84][85] Once the series was green-lit, the Duffer Brothers contacted Survive around July 2015 to ask if they were still doing music; the two provided the production team with dozens of songs from their band's past to gain their interest, helping to land them the role.[82]\nIn addition to original music, Stranger Things features period music from artists including Joy Division, Toto, New Order, the Bangles, Foreigner, Bon Jovi, The Police, Echo and the Bunnymen, Peter Gabriel, and Corey Hart, as well as excerpts from Tangerine Dream, John Carpenter, and Vangelis.[86][87] Some songs have been used as narrative elements, such as The Clash's \"Should I Stay or Should I Go\" within the first season,[87] and Kate Bush's \"Running Up That Hill\" in the fourth. Some of these licensed songs saw subsequent resurgence on sales charts after the respective seasons they featured in aired, most notably \"Running Up That Hill\" and Metallica's \"Master of Puppets\" in the fourth season, and Limahl's \"The NeverEnding Story\" in the third season.[88][89][90]\nSoundtracks containing separately the original compositions and the licensed music for each season have been released by Lakeshore Records.\n\nRelease\nThe first season consisted of eight one-hour-long episodes which were released worldwide on Netflix on July 15, 2016,[91] in Ultra HD 4K. The second season, consisting of nine episodes, was released on October 27, 2017, in HDR.[92][93] The third season once again consists of eight episodes,[94] and was released on July 4, 2019.[95] The fourth season, consisting of nine episodes, was released in two volumes on May 27 and July 1, 2022, respectively.[96] In February 2022, Netflix renewed the series for a fifth and final season.[97] The fifth season premiered its first volume on November 26, 2025; its second volume is slated for release on December 25, 2025, concluding with the series finale on December 31.[28]\nShortly after the fourth season's release, viewers reported that Will's friends did not acknowledge his birthday in an episode of the season that took place on that day. The Duffers said in an interview that they could rectify the matter by changing its month, which they called \"George Lucas-ing the situation\", in reference to the canon changes that George Lucas had made to the original Star Wars trilogy to match what the prequel trilogy had added.[98] Some viewers took this to imply that scenes from earlier seasons were also being edited, including one scene where Jonathan takes discreet pictures of a pool party that Steve, Nancy, and Barbara are holding. The writers stated that \"no scenes from previous seasons have ever been cut or re-edited\", including this scene.[98]\n\nHome media\nThe first season was released on a Blu-ray/DVD combo pack exclusively to Target retailers on October 17, 2017, and the same for the 4K/Blu-ray combo pack on November 15, 2017, both of which includes vintage CBS-FOX VHS-inspired packaging.[99][100] The second season received a similar release on November 6, 2018.[101][102]\n\nReception\n\nAudience viewership\nNetflix did not initially reveal subscriber viewership numbers for their original series, and Symphony Technology Group compiled data for the season based on people using software on their phones that measures television viewing by detecting a program's sound. According to Symphony, within the first 35 days of release, Stranger Things averaged ratings of around 14.07 million adults between the ages of 18 and 49 in the United States. This made it the third most-watched season of Netflix original content in the U.S. at the time behind the first season of Fuller House and fourth season of Orange Is the New Black.[103] In a September 2016 analysis, Netflix found that Stranger Things \"hooked\" viewers by the second episode of the first season, indicating that the second episode was \"the first installment that led at least 70 percent of viewers who watched that episode to complete the entire first season of a show\".[104]\nFor the third season, Netflix revealed that the show had broken viewing records for Netflix, with 40.7 million households having watched the show in its first four days, and 18.2 million already watched the entire series within that timeframe.[105] Within its first month, the third season was watched by 64 million households, setting a new record for the most-watched original Netflix series.[106][107]\nThe series is the most followed TV show on social media app TV Time's history, with over 5 million followers.[108]\n\nCritical response\n\nRotten Tomatoes gave the show an overall score of 92%,[119] while Metacritic gave the show an overall score of 74.[120]\nReview aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave the first season an approval rating of 97% based on 92 reviews and a weighted average rating of 8.2/10.

On Rotten Tomatoes, it holds an 86% critics' score at the time of writing, indicating overall favorable reviews, though some critics expressed reservations about the series' ongoing narrative and character development. Several reviewers also commented on the density and complexity of the season. Ben Travers of IndieWire stated that season five \"leaves you wanting less,\" and Michael Walsh of Nerdist observed that the first four episodes contain \"too much story, too many characters, and too many complicated/convoluted developments.\"[126]\n\n\nShannon Purser's performance as Barb received widespread attention from fans and led to her being nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series.\nStranger Things gained a dedicated fan base soon after its release. One area of focus was the character of Barb, Nancy's nerdy friend and classmate who is taken and killed by the monster early in the season.[127] According to actress Shannon Purser, Barb \"wasn't supposed to be a big deal\", and the Duffer Brothers had not gone into great detail about the character since the focus was on finding Will. However, many fans sympathized with the character; Laura Bradley of Vanity Fair suggested that Barb would be a similar misfit in society, and \"looks more like someone you might actually meet in real life\" compared to the other characters, particularly Nancy. Hashtags grew in popularity after the series' release, such as \"#ImWithBarb\" and \"#JusticeforBarb\", and several fan sites and forums were created to support her.[128]\nPurser did not return for the second season, but the Duffer Brothers used the real-life \"Justice for Barb\" movement as inspiration for narrative at the start of the second season: Nancy addresses the fact \"that no one ever cares about\" Barb.[26] Purser and several media outlets took her nomination as Barb for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series in the Primetime Emmy Awards as achieving \"Justice for Barb\", highlighting how well her character was received.[129][130][131]\nAnother impact of the series has been an increased demand for Eggo waffles, as they are shown to be Eleven's favorite food in several episodes and are seen as a representation of the series.[132] The Kellogg Company manufactures Eggo and had not been part of the production prior to the first season's release, but they recognized the market impact of the series. They provided a vintage 1980s Eggo television advertisement for Netflix to use in its Super Bowl LI commercial, and they intend to become more involved with cross-promotion.[133] Coca-Cola released a limited run of New Coke (introduced in 1985) to coincide with the third season of the show, which takes place in 1985.[134]\n\nControversies\nIn April 2018, filmmaker Charlie Kessler filed a lawsuit against the Duffer Brothers, claiming that they stole his idea behind his short film Montauk, which featured a similar premise of a missing boy, a nearby military base doing otherworldly experiments, and a monster from another dimension. Kessler directed the film and debuted it at the 2012 Hamptons International Film Festival. During the Tribeca Film Festival in April 2014, he pitched his film to the Duffer brothers and later gave them \"the script, ideas, story and film\" for a larger film idea which he called The Montauk Project. Kessler contended that the Duffer brothers used his ideas to devise the premise for Stranger Things and sought a third of the income that they had made from the series.[135][136]\nThe Duffer brothers' lawyer stated that they never saw Kessler's film nor spoke to him regarding it, and that Kessler had no input into their concepts for Stranger Things.[137] The judge denied summary judgment for the Duffer brothers in April 2019, allowing Kessler's suit to proceed to trial.[138] Just before the trial was due to start in May 2019, Kessler withdrew his lawsuit after hearing the depositions and seeing documents from as early as 2010 which showed him that the Duffers had independently come up with the concept of Stranger Things.[139]\nJournalists have noted that the idea of supernatural events around Montauk had originated due to urban legend of the Montauk Project, which came to light from the 1992 book The Montauk Project: Experiments in Time.[140][141][142]\nIn September 2017, multiple media outlets published articles about a cease-and-desist letter sent by a Netflix in-house attorney to the operator of a Stranger-Things-themed bar in Chicago.[144] The letter included humorous references to the series: \"unless I'm living in the Upside Down\"; \"we're not going to go full Dr. Brenner on you\"; \"the demogorgon is not always as forgiving\". The letter also won praise from lawyers for its even-handedness in not demanding immediate closure of the bar, only demanding that the bar not remain open without Netflix's permission past its initial scheduled run.\nIn July 2022, six Jewish and Roma groups condemned the use of Lukiškės Prison as a filming location for the fourth season. Protesters pointed out the prison's involvement in the Holocaust and its role in the Ponary massacre; denounced Netflix's partnering with local tourism board Go Vilnius to rent out a refurbished Stranger Things-themed prison cell on Airbnb; and criticized Netflix's decision to repost images of fans' Eleven-inspired numerical tattoos on their Instagram, saying it \"desecrates the living memories of Holocaust survivors\". A petition calling on Netflix to close the rental and apologize garnered more than 60,000 signatures, leading Go Vilnius to shut down the Airbnb listing indefinitely. Multiple news outlets contacted Netflix for comment, but received no response.[145][146][147]\n\nAccolades\n\nStranger Things has received numerous awards and nominations across the entertainment industry, including ten Primetime Emmy Award nominations and four Golden Globe Award nominations through the second season. The series' cast has received several of these: the series' first-season cast won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series, while series leads Ryder, Brown, and Harbour have earned individual awards and nominations.\n\nFranchise\n\nThe success of the titular series resulted in a wider multimedia franchise being established, which encompasses the original series, various television spin-offs, a stage play, a line of novels and comics, several video games, and extensive licensed merchandise.\n\nIn popular culture\n\nUnited States Representative David Cicilline compared the state of the nation during the presidency of Donald Trump to that of Stranger Things during a speech given in Congress on February 16, 2017, using a sign \"Trump Things\" in the same format as the title card of the series and saying \"Like the main characters in Stranger Things, we are now stuck in the Upside Down\".[148]\n\nReferences\n\n^ \"Stranger Things\".
