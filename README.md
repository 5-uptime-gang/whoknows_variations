# Legacy Python → Modern Go Migration

We are currently in the process of rewriting this Python 2 legacy project into a modern Go stack. There’s no grand rationale behind the stack choice—our main goal is to emulate what it feels like to work with a mandated stack in a corporate environment.  

We will be continuously working on migrating the project, so you’ll gradually see the project evolve over time.  

A big part of this project is also about gradually implementing CI/CD pipelines and adhering to DevOps principles.  

Originally, this project comes from our instructor, who most likely was part of the legendary monk squad that wrote this ultra-modern project back in the day. It carries a very secretive kind of energy.  

In the end, we aim to maintain only 5% uptime.
